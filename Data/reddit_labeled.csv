Logically, this makes sense, since you have to give up control of your money for them to lend it out.

I‚Äôd rather use grayscales updates direct from them on Twitter. Indeed it is based on the USD value. At the time of their update last night it claimed a $16.9 million AUM up from $8.7 million.
Indeed at the old rate of a $8.7 million AUM the amount of XLM was indeed 27.17 million Lumens.
As of yesterday‚Äôs increase to $16.9 million AUM, that they announced at 9.47pm UTC, either the price of XLM increased to $0.622 to allow those 27.17 million to become worth $16.9 million or they added roughly 28.54 million Lumens to their holdings. 
27.17 million + 28.54 million = 55.71 million Lumens
55.71 million * 0.303 (usd price of Lumens at 9.47pm UTC last night) = $16.88 million.

My big concern is that XLM meets the 'Howey Test', something I really wish it didn't. Can anyone agree or disagree with this? I'm putting it out there in the hope of inspiring debate and correcting what the conclusion that I have come to.
&amp;#x200B;
  
The test is:  
1) Investment of Money - do you use 'money' to buy the asset (Yes)  
2) Expectation of profits due to other peoples work - specifically   
*An Active Participant is responsible for the development, improvement (or enhancement), operation, or promotion of the network,*[*\[15\]*](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets#_edn15) *particularly if purchasers of the digital asset expect an AP to be performing or overseeing tasks that are necessary for the network or digital asset to achieve or retain its intended purpose or functionality.*[*\[16\]*](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets#_edn16)
* *Where the network or the digital asset is still in development and the network or digital asset is not fully functional at the time of the offer or sale, purchasers would reasonably expect an AP to further develop the functionality of the network or digital asset (directly or indirectly).¬† This particularly would be the case where an AP promises further developmental efforts in order for the digital asset to attain or grow in value.*
SDF holds funds to pay developers etc. It decides how much to pay them. It manages the marketing of Stellar as a solution. It's an AP. Most people who hold XLM are not the people building the service, we are standing on the shoulders of giants. So it's a Yes from me on this point.  
3) Expectation of profits - specifically is it designed to devalue over time (no), is traded on a secondary market (yes),  little correlation between the amount traded and the real world value that is held by the traders (yes). So yes, I think no-one here is in this as a benevolent act. We all think the network will become more valuable.
4) It can be immediately used as payment of goods or services, without conversion to another FIAT or crypto currency - I don't think this is the case.",1611139375,1611157375,1/20/2021 5:42,1

204,204,jonofire,"Welcome to Lumen Club (this is not an actual club, just some observations)...
Let‚Äôs go over the rules of Lumen Club for the new Lumenauts.
Rule 1: While Lumens will always have utility in the Stellar network, the price of Lumens denominated in fiat currency may be volatile and could lose significant value.
Rule 2: Refrain from referring to your Lumen balance as an ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù (see rule 1). Holding the native asset with the intent to sell for fiat at a higher price is a high-risk speculative play based on your anticipation of increased future demand. Speculate with caution and only risk as much as you are willing to lose.
Rule 3: Refrain from referring to the Stellar network or its native asset as a ‚Äúsleeping giant‚Äù. If you zoom out on your chart to the last 5 years, the price of the native asset has never been ‚Äúasleep‚Äù, and there are no ‚Äúgiants‚Äù working at the SDF - just bright minds hoping to build an open and inclusive financial future for all.
Rule 4: It‚Äôs Jed, not Jeb.
Rule 5: When the price of the Lumen starts to decline to the point of discomfort, refrain from desperate pleas for announcements, news or marketing from the SDF to pump the price of your heavy bags. Instead, be respectful of the mission, but also thankful that the SDF has not made any forward-looking statements on the price of the native asset. The absence of such statements is an invaluable asset in itself.",1611125839,1611143839,1/20/2021 1:57,1

With its ""fairness"" non-existent in other blockchains it's really an amazing accomplishment. 
However, this fairness means its a sum of value of all assets connected (anchored) to it. If Bitcoin would happen to go down to say, 0,  and likewise nearly all of Crypto's combined with it... an attack on Bitcoin, Ethereum and or any other Proof of Work Blockchain would then leave XLM's value heavily tied to it.
Does SDF have a fail switch or anything that would ever trigger if an asset like this suddenly went to 0 to remove itself from the chain prior? 
If it's the 5sec tx window, (header-check), \*shut off\*, transact.
Or do we just push SDF to remove all foreign-tied assets now? 
What happens to users holding Bitcoin on, say, AnchorUSD when the switch would get pulled? 
Can they be cashed out to USD?

364,364,teslaorbust,"I've been contemplating the price of stellar for the last several months as I like to do my due diligence.  I love the SDF and model of this crypto.  I believe it has real world use going forward once banks/CBDC's jump on board.  
That being said, at some point I feel the price will get too high for the practical use of Stellar and their mission won't be possible.  To help alleviate this problem, Stellar has voting protocols that allow for more XLM to be made or for transaction fee's to actually be released again into the system.  These things need to pass a vote, but I'm sure they would given the use cases at that point. 
I feel like the SDF is genuinely interested in making the financial sector a better place.  Rather than trying to drive up XLM price, I feel like they would cap it at a certain point to ensure the max number of users could use it.   If XLM ever did hit $100, a bank with 60 million customers would have to invest $6 billion for start up costs and then probably another $15 billion for transactional costs... it isn't practical at a certain point. 
So... best case scenario for long term success is getting banks and CBDC's on board rather quickly before a bunch of retail investors make this space too expensive.  While I want to see price grow because I'm an investor in this space, I'm somewhat nervous about XLM becoming too expensive and then not allowing the project to maximize its potential.  
&amp;#x200B;
TLDR:  Need to get banks and CBDC on board stellar before it becomes too expensive.  Otherwise Stellar will probably have to change the supply or transaction fee's to off-set costs (drive price lower).",1611075435,1611093435,1/19/2021 11:57,0

573,573,teslaorbust,you need 1XLM in an address to have a successful transaction,1611010534,1611028534,1/18/2021 17:55,0
574,574,teslaorbust,"I'm going to assume 1XLM for each customer so its easier for tracking/looking back at past transactions.  with this assumption, here is some DD. 
From strictly a price per XLM standpoint, we aren't as worried about transactions, as we are # of accounts.  There are currently 4.9+million Stellar addresses with 3.9 million owning 10 or less XLM.  This means there is roughly 1 million entities or investors in this space.   I would assume a majority of these individuals/entities are holding as only 22,000 accounts are active daily on average (2.2% of large holders).  To put that in perspective, in 2018 the height of stellar price, we saw upwards of 300,000 active addresses.  
So, there are no major CBDC currently on Stellar.  They are in the works, but nothing currently.   Ukraine's top bank has 20 million customers.  If there is 1XLM for each customer, there will now be 20 million + new holders of Stellar.  roughly a 400% increase from our current landscape.  On top of that, the bank will probably secure an additonal 100 million XLM for daily transactions.   If there is ever a big announcement in the U.S and banks or the Fed goes with Stellar (this is a huge if), then there are 124 million households currently using a bank in the U.S.  Add on top of this 25 electric transactions/month for an average american (3.1 billion trans/month) and banks in the U.S would probably buy an additional 1 billion XLM.  
I hate hearing ""we are early"" in the crypto space.. but we actually are early in the XLM space.  This is a bet that Stellar is the chosen blockchain for CBDC's going forward.  If it is, then the price tag for investors will be massive.  Even if XLM gets up to $50, that is simply a $50 1 time bank fee (instead of the normal $12/month) for all users.  
In Summary, the more CBDC or banks get on board, the more unknowing holders we have of XLM to sustain the new financial system.  This would drastically reduce the circulating supply of XLM.  If no CBDC or large banks sign on with SDF, then this is just a speculative investment at best.  If SDF positions itself as the leader in this space, then the sky is the limit.   I don't want to give a price prediction in that case because its just unneeded as of right now.  But my cue will be to see if any countries follow Ukraine in the next 2 years.  that will be the key for this investment. 
&amp;#x200B;
TLDR: There are only 4.9 million stellar accounts. Large banks often have 20-60 million customers. 1 large bank or CBDC will greatly increase demand/# of holders/reduced circulating supply.  Price should jump as CBDC or banks come on board",1611010476,1611028476,1/18/2021 17:54,1

580,580,joemehl,"I don't think AnchorUSD is trying to be a tool for day trading. I see it more tailored towards users like myself who have a not too small and not too big investment and want to earn interest on my stack.
The app has features like a lending platform and it is also very reliable during huge swings. I've only seen the app go down once in the four months I've used it.
I love the idea that if there was an emergency, I could take out a low risk loan against my stack and have fiat available to me without having to compromise my position.
Their loans are very flexible and their options for earning interest are also fleshed out nicely and explained in a way that is easy to understand. 
There's a reason XLM only pays 2.8% interest as opposed to 5 or 8 for other cryptos. AnchorUSD knows the value that Stellar brings to the market and they are not going to give big incentives for XLM interest because they want to keep as much XLM as possible themselves!

I don't see how Stellar's minimum balance requirement is related to this at all. The following scenarios exist:
* You use the **Payment** operation to transfer funds to an **existing** account: all fine, funds arrive.
* You use the **Create Account** operation to transfer funds to a **non-existent** account: all fine, funds arrive.
* You use the **Payment** operation to transfer funds to a **non-existent** account: transaction fails with `PAYMENT_NO_DESTINATION`.
* You use the **Create Account** operation to transfer funds to an **existing** account: transaction fails with `CREATE_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXIST`.
In the latter two cases, your lumens aren't lost, they just remain on the sending account. That's what a failed transaction means. It's like if nothing happened.",1610982950,1611000950,1/18/2021 10:15,1

699,699,space-72,"Hey, everyone, I wanted to share some of my thoughts regarding Stellar and the reason why I think it is such a powerful technology.
Like many of you, I became interested in Stellar because of what it provides people around the world. I'll be honest, though, seeing the success of other coins and the millionaires created virtually overnight undoubtedly influenced my decision to become involved in cryptocurrency. Thankfully this was well after the peak several years ago. 
Over the past month, the price of Stellar has been on everyone's mind because I think many of us are hoping to have stumbled on a technology that brings about a transformational monetary change in each of our lives. I certainly hope that for myself and everyone who believes in Stellar. Perhaps, though, everyone may take a moment to reflect on some of the original reasons why we first became interested in Stellar in the first place.
Remittances.
I did a quick google search last night to see how much money was transferred through remittances, one of the primary roles that Stellar assumes. A quick search revealed that over 500 billion dollars (USD) are sent via remittances in 2017. \* 
Oftentimes, people who send remittances use companies like Western Union. I have personally never used any of these transfer systems, but I decided to test how much it would cost to send $100 USD to India from the U.S. To complete this transaction, it would cost $11 and take between 0-1 business days to reach the recipient.
Think about Stellar. To send any amount to anyone in the world is .00001 lumen and is virtually instant. Math isn't my strong suit, but I'll try and throw out some numbers. A $100 USD transaction through Western Union is $11, while the same transfer would cost roughly .000003 cents with Stellar sitting at .3. This is an astounding difference to simply send money. At the end of the day, companies like Western Union may provide a service to people, but they do so at the incredible expense of hard-working people. Stellar, on the other hand, provides a cheap and equitable means of sending and receiving money for a fraction of the cost. For you math people out there, I would love to know how much more expensive this comparison is via a percent.
Anyway, the point of all of this is to show people that Stellar is doing what it was intended to do. We may never see $3, $5, or $10 a coin, but as long as it continues to provide cost-efficient and equitable services to everyone in the world, I'm ok with that.
&amp;#x200B;

Though once they left stellar I stopped using it. Last I heard they were going to polkadot, which does not have parachains/smart contracts yet (sometime this year). Looks like their parachain/blockchain will be called Arcadia, and they have a testnet. Though if you don't know about polkadot all this will not make sense. I doubt they will be one of the first to get a parachain which means they either build on another parachain or go the parathread option. They also state they plan on making a bridge to stellar as their first crossbridge.

1049,1049,romangiler,"Characteristics of Money!
Money is a medium of exchange; it allows people to obtain what they need to live.
Bartering was one way that people exchanged goods for other goods before money was created.
Like gold and other precious metals, money has worth because for most people it represents something valuable. And crypto is no different.
Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity but by the stability of the issuing government.
Money is separated into three categories so that it is more discernible for measurement purposes:
M1 ‚Äì This category of money includes all physical denominations of coins and currency; demand deposits, which are checking accounts and NOW accounts; and travelers' checks. This category of money is the narrowest of the three, and is essentially the money used to buy things and make payments 
M2 ‚Äì With broader criteria, this category adds all the money found in M1 to all time-related deposits, savings accounts deposits, and non-institutional money market funds. This category represents money that can be readily transferred into cash.
M3 ‚Äì The broadest class of money, M3 combines all money found in the M2 definition and adds to it all large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements, along with other larger liquid assets.",1610862859,1610880859,1/17/2021 0:54,0
1050,1050,ExactStart,"Thanks for the feedback! That essentially the way I understand it too. The people giving out the loans don't take risk since the collateral is always greater than the sum of the loan plus the interest. If the price starts to drop there's a trigger in the smart contracts that just liquidates that collateral so the people lending will always get their money plus interest back. 
There's some more money in providing liquidity, fees, and how the different governing tokens work, but I haven't found as much real world applicability. It all seems like mostly gambling. And don't get me wrong, I think there's a place for stuff like this since there's plenty in existing finance that's literally gambling. The appeal is that there's no middleman or regulation. I was just hoping it was something more like decentralized mortgage or small business loan that could actually make a positive impact in the world. 
I'll keep looking into it since there are some things I don't understand like yield farming, but I was pretty disappointed when I found out what DeFi really was. Is there anything else to it that you know of?",1610862425,1610880425,1/17/2021 0:47,1

By using the ubiquitous local cell phone providers and the mobile money they offer throughout Uganda, users can easily buy Lumens (XLM) from eSACCO using basic text messaging. Once they have some XLM, they can then go into the store of a vendor using the eSACCO app on their smartphone, or with a eSACCO point of sale device and buy goods directly using Lumens. This allows your average person to have their money stored safely away on the Stellar Network, instead of on their person at all times. And to top it off, eSACCO pays 18% interest on the user‚Äôs savings. This is a benefit over the standard mobile money.
Even more interesting, Ugandans can go into a vendor who uses the eSACCO app, and convert their Ugandan Shillings into XLM which is sent to their personal account. So we see hard cash being converted in real time into digital money, in a small, rural African town. And if a user needs cash, they can go to a vendor and exchange their XLM for hard cash.",1610856996,1610874996,1/16/2021 23:16,1

Reading the Stellar docs, it's clear that lumens exist to facilitate the movement of other currencies over the Stellar network. You need one lumen to have a Stellar account, and spend a tiny fraction of a lumen per transaction (any size transaction). Based on that usage, the only reason for the price to go up would be for usage to go up; i.e. more accounts and more transactions.
Having said that, people *can* use Lumens like they use Bitcoin - as a direct store of value and an investment. From that perspective it could act like bitcoin. But it uses a different method of consensus than mining (honestly I don't understand it), and as noted above this isn't the stated purpose of the coin.

All the proponents of xrp and xlm had to do with bank partnerships and what not but I think in this new frontier and world we are heading to, they are going to be less prevalent with more and more of the population being to bank themselves, that‚Äôs the whole point of crypto really. 
The only arguments from proponents is always - regulations and banks won‚Äôt allow so join them- I disagree with this. I believe regulations are going to absolutely be favorable for a digital crypto token economy and banks will be a part of it but they are going to be the road less traveled. Just like Uber/Lyft taking a big pie of the taxi industry, air bnb with the hotel industry, crypto will do the same with the finance industry. And in this regard is why I have many coins like btc, eth, Ada, nano, as well as the banker coins.

Basically you need a weight of 2 to make transactions with your account or to remove the multisig. Your GCDH address has a weight of 1 so it would require the GAHD address to sign the transaction as well for a combined weight of 2. The third address, GCMF, has weight 2 so it can sign transactions for your account on its own.
If you have either of the private keys to the other accounts you can use https://laboratory.stellar.org/ to build a transaction and move your funds (or ""set options"" to change the multisig).",1610782585,1610800585,1/16/2021 2:36,1

Lightnet is a cross border payment company built from the groundup for public networks. They are projecting $2 billion in transactions by 2022. They had one of the largest rounds of fund raising in SE Asia history.

Velo uses the SCP.
If Lightnet, a private company, proves to be scalable and profitable it will have proven out the concept of cryptocurrencies and public networks. If so, we're likely to see explosive growth in competitors. Nothing creates growth better than a profitable enterprise in a brand new business segment. 
Outside of wallets to store crypto, exchanges to speculate on crypto and defi to further speculate on crypto, cryptocurrencies haven't really proven out a profitable concept as of yet. Lightnet is trying to do that and Lightnet runs on Velo and Velo runs on Stellar.

\`Founded by former Qualcomm, Intel, and Dropbox engineers in late-2017, Solana is a single-chain, Proof-of-Stake protocol whose focus is on delivering scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security. Solana can currently handle 50,000 TPS with single transaction costs as low as $0.00001.
Core to Solana‚Äôs scaling solution is a decentralized clock titled Proof-of-History (PoH), built to solve the problem of time in distributed networks where there is not a single, trusted, source of time. By using Verifiable Delay Functions, PoH allows each node to locally generate timestamps with SHA256 computations. This eliminates the need for the broadcasts of timestamps across the network, improving overall network efficiency\`

As with anything, you get in what you put out. It sounds like you don't know much about the asset (Stellar/XLM) you bought, and that's ok - I would recommend googling or wikipediaing the basics of investment, economic principles, asset pricing, supply/demand, in a general sense - and then go on to read specifically about what Stellar is. 
Coinbase is an exchange, so its not going to tell you anything about XLM beyond its price. Also, after doing the above suggestions, only use Coinbasepro to purchase, not coinbase, as the latter has very high fees ontop of the actual ""true"" asset price.

2202,2202,mad_op_king,"While Stellar is steadily on its way to become an established payment network, we need to consider what it prevents from being adopted by the general public.
Currently, there are two major issues.  
The first one is privacy.   
This becomes clear once you look at your transaction history on Stellar Expert.   
Public keys of big known entities, such as the Coinbase Exchange or the SDF wallets, are mapped directly to its owner.    
In the future, when retailers such as Amazon, Netflix or even your local drug store accept XLM, all transactions will be publicly historized on the blockchain.   
Now, if you send a transaction to a friend or if your name and address, in combination with your public key, gets leaked to the internet, everyone would have access to your entire purchasing history.
This would be the ultimate privacy breach.
Shufflers are known to only partially obfuscate sender and receiver and are therefore not a solution either.
We would either need a shuffler directly integrated into the Stellar protocol or need to deposit Lumens into a centralized ""bank"" that would do the shuffling for us. The latter would mean more regulation.
Another issue is the loss of one's secret key. It happens quite often. It is said that 20% of all Bitcoin is irreversibly lost.  
Could you ever imagine your grandparents to securely store their secret keys?   
Could you imagine the general public to do so?   
Vitalik Buterin recently wrote an article about ""guardians"", i.e. trusted entities that could overwrite your secret key in the case of loss.
An alternative would - again - be a bank that you grant permission to overwrite your secret keys in the case of loss on your end.  
There is no way around these issues in order for Stellar (and cryptocurrency in general) to become widely used by the general population.  
What would your solution be to these two issues?",1610579254,1610597254,1/13/2021 18:07,1

2269,2269,4bidden450,"Vonovia issues fully digital bond via online marketplace firstwire for the first time
Security tokens used for ownership transfer
M.M. Warburg Bank first investor
Further digital emissions possible
Bochum, 13. January 2021 - Vonovia is further expanding the digitization of the financial sector. The housing company issued a fully digital registered bond of ‚Ç¨20 million for the first time. The term is 3 years. For the issue, security tokens were used to transfer ownership of the claim under the highest security standards. **The transfers of ownership of real assets take place on the established Stellar Blockchain, which is used internationally for transactions.**
The transaction is a novelty on the capital market: Vonovia created the token independently via the online marketplace firstwire. On the platform, which brings issuers and investors together directly and in real time, Vonovia had already placed a Schuldschein loan of ‚Ç¨50 million in September 2019.
Only in mid-December had the Federal Cabinet adopted a draft law on the introduction of electronic securities, which was intended to promote the digitization of the financial center Germany and meet a central demand of the Federal Government's blockchain strategy for more transparency, market integrity and investor protection.
Digitization offers us the opportunity to finance ourselves faster, easier and cheaper, says Helene von Roeder, CFO of Vonovia. The company has been successfully financed by the capital market for years and uses a wide range of financial instruments for this purpose. We want to try out the new technology to gain experience. We can well imagine that this will play an important role in the capital market in the future. Issues are transparent and traceable in real time, which guarantees a professional transaction standard. In addition, we can address new investors globally.
On the investor side, the tokens offer new perspectives for banks and their customers: ""Tokenization will significantly expand and structurally change the range of financial products and services,"" says Joachim Olearius, spokesman for the partners of the owner-managed M.M. Warburg Bank. We are pleased to have successfully carried out this transaction with an experienced issuer. It underlines the innovative strength of our bank.
Michael Dreiner, CEO and founder of the online marketplace firstwire, sees the transaction as a milestone because the use of tokens thus enters the institutional capital market and has the potential to change the bond business sustainably. Against the background of the draft law for electronic securities, this transaction shows how bond issues can also be designed in the future. On firstwire, companies can now digitally close their emissions in real time, which means immediate settlement and no longer a settlement risk lasting several days."" Firstwire realized the technological implementation with the cooperation partner Bitbond.",1610569095,1610587095,1/13/2021 15:18,1

It won't look nearly as appealing as arbitraging some crypto's on exchanges but Stellar will see so much movement between differing global currency anchors it will be the live-market benchmark for the global economy.
As XLM's value goes up it = the combined average of all global currencies.

2675,2675,XIMcoincom,"Kin was a payment project from the kik messenger and originally they were on Stellar back in the day. They had millions of users and basically left to start their own ecosystem (using a copy of Stellar which is open source) specifically over the activation (1XLM) and trustline costs (0.5XLM) their argument was they couldn't scale to many millions of accounts with these costs so they disabled these in their own copy. (XLM was .40 cents\~ at the time)  This was well before the new Stellar sponsorship features which are now available and if they had have hung around perhaps they could have made it work.
Then they got hit with a $100m SEC fine for promoting their on platform and essentially the whole project was sunk until recently after years in court they settled for $5m. At which point Solana has come into existence and gave them a huge payout to get them to ditch their own now tainted platform and move over to Solana.
My take on Solana is that its new and yes lighting fast, less than half a second from people I know who have played with it. The advantage Stellar has is its mature codebase, documentation and SDF if they can generate enough business links specifically geographical anchors. There is also a question of how much the end user cares about .4 seconds vs 4 seconds which is tough to say. Ultimately i think that Solana is a true competitor to Stellar but it really comes down to can SDF generate enough traction/ adopton for the speed difference not to matter.",1610479230,1610497230,1/12/2021 14:20,1

1. Jed McCaleb is crypto Jesus. He is *the* guy.  He practically created the space by launching Mt Gox.  
2. The Stellar protocol is crypto heaven.  Transaction speed, cost, integrity are unmatched.  (facebook tried with libra which is/was basically a 1:1 clone)
3. Satoshi and bitcoin are the crypto devil and crypto hell respectively.  Satoshi the mysterious underworld character who enables darknet btc transactions to occur so anarchists can run amuck. 
4. Dan Larimer and Vitalik are crypto apostles who should be working at Jed's side, not competing with him.  EOS and all the other Larimer iterations of his entanglement protocols are well represented in Jed's Stellar gospel.  The book of ETH however should not be included in the crypto bible.  ETH is false prophecy plain and simple.

How does exchange work?
You need to pay a transaction fee, that happens anytime you want to send from one wallet to another one.

You'll need to use an exchange like Coinbase, Kraken, etc. Ledger comes with its own software and you can sell through there but I think you should look at the exchange rates and fees in various exchanges.

I can't, I use a hardware wallet so I don't know about android wallets, sorry. You should do your own research to see which one supports the cryptos you'll like to store.

The irony is now that the network service Ripple now sells **for profit** doesn't utilize what it initially sold as a token of itself  and claiming **Utility**. A double sided no-win situation.

Personally, I don't believe they intended to do such a thing but that's the trouble with being the first in the space. They advertised it implying a security without knowing that it would become a problem later as it was similar in concept. 
It made sense as people already knew what a security was and that this would be the new way of providing such service in the future. It got them the needed attention!

\- SDF received $3MM in exchange for the same $$ amount of lumens from Stripe (2% of the supply at the time). An exchange on both ends to try and grow the ecosystem. What got Ripple into trouble is them manipulating the market price and dumping on the open market with the sole purpose of making a profit.
\- SDF is a non-profit and there was no ICO. They have also been VERY clear in their messaging that XLM is NOT an investment or partial interest in the SDF
\- XLM is a native utility token being used on a decentralized network. It HAS to be used.  It might increase in value, but that is simply due to Metcalfe's law. Its not a direct result of the SDF's performance (earnings, etc).
\- SDF is actively working with regulatory bodies to educate policymakers on blockchain and try to get more regulatory clarity. 
To me, XLM simply doesn't fail all parts of the Howey test convincingly enough. I also think Ripple is going to settle with the SEC and that they even have a chance of beating the case because while they may be guilty in the court of public opinion, the SEC has to prove without a shadow of a doubt that XRP is a security.",1610413740,1610431740,1/11/2021 20:09,1

3042,3042,potato_teko,"‚Äú..Stellar, which is designed to connect all the world's currencies on a single platform, unlocks a whole new realm of payment-related applications for USDC..‚Äù 
This somehow reminds me of Stellar which focuses on ‚Äòemerging countries‚Äô. In some countries, cryptocurrencies, which are more reliable than their fiat currencies, are aggressively traded (https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins). Under these circumstances, the price of Bitcoin fell in March 2020 and the dramatic increase in the inflow of funds to US dollar-based stable-coins was reported in media. [Tether Market Cap Soars $2B Since March ‚Äî Biggest Monthly Inflow Ever](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-market-cap-soars-2b-since-march-biggest-monthly-inflow-ever) 
There are more countries than we think that appreciates ‚Äústable coins‚Äù due to both a means of storing value and convenience. Unlike USDT, USDC can offer us a regulatory approved fiat-backed stable-coin with a 100% fiat currency collateral. The needs will be very high. If I were living in especially those countries, the cost of transaction fees would be one of my most important factors in deciding which blockchain to use. Stellar degined transaction fees to be ‚Äòsurprisingly‚Äô low and transaction speed fast. This is extraordinary. Stellar designed a blockchain literally for the people.. THIS is one of the true nature of Stellar.
This changes the world for the better.

I own both XLM and XRP. Ripple might get some fines, but I am confident the ruling in the case will be that even if XRP ever were a security, it is no longer.
XLM and XRP are coins designed for markets that crossover each other, if not the same sectors in many cases. Owning both of the leading competitors in this category is probably wise.
And while being partnered with Ripple does not necessarily indicate XRP use, the number of prestigious Ripple partnerships is staggering, which is very bullish for XRP in the long term which boosts current speculative market price, even if it isn't bullish for it in the short term when considering active utility.",1610385648,1610403648,1/11/2021 12:20,0

The APIs they integrate with Fireblocks and Prime Trust, however, utilize other blockchains to provide the liquidity needed for AnchorUSD's additional assets. They centralize these processes into conventional APIs.
Although AnchorUSD does not use PoW directly, the APIs and therefore Fireblocks and Prime Trust leverage PoW solutions to make the functionality available. 
The risk-factor here won't be that your XLM are lost; more so that if these those other chains are affected, the functionality enabled by them would cease to exist. The logic behind AnchorUSD's smart contracts would be affected so if you utilize said features...something iffy theoretically could happen albeit nothing proven to date.
Going back to my above statements around why Stellar is now baking these features in natively would be to remove the reliance on said APIs and, likewise, their dependence on PoW systems and keep everything in-network and more secure.",1610381944,1610399944,1/11/2021 11:19,0

I always sort of figured that when it reaches a point, some smart investors who have now made their retirement money, and are going to continue to be smart, and move on, drink beer on the beach and be merry.  Due to that, its gonna dip.
I have also read others who say, strap in, it could be a lengthy recovery.

3352,3352,matusvo,"I admit, I might have been a bit too ignorant about Ripple's technical capabilities and I should've informed myself better before posting.
I still have good reasons to believe that Ripple is immoral, at least in my opinion, and they shouldn't be a dominant part of the financial revolution. 
Firstly, because they're a for profit company. They keep marketing and saying XRP will go up etc. Why? You don't need to do any of this to make the price go up if you're doing good job and getting organic interest and adoption. They're tiny details, and most people don't see anything wrong with this, some people are probably even encouraged by this, but it matters to me. 
Secondly, if anything is true from the lawsuit, it's probably that they knew about the potential legal trouble, because Jed setup Stellar in a very specific way to avoid this. This was probably part of the reason he left in the first place, at least I know I would leave if my partners didn't want to do anything about potential legal issues.
There's definitely room for both Stellar and Ripple. But I don't see Ripple's future bright (I didn't say no future), or at least I hope, mostly because of the moral concerns. Hopefully, Stellar takes over most of Ripples market, because given the choice between the two, I don't see a reason to choose Ripple.

Once calculated, though, this would be a huge boon.  My brain can't full wrap around it alone, though.
Coming back to reality, the way Crypto works currently, sadly, does not yield these benefits you mention and instead uses the tried and true market making systems which these principles can be applied to.

This would be at the App layer where the customization is occurring which makes sense given Fireblock's APIs. 
I don't believe AnchorUSD has ever received SDF funding for their work so my above case around sharing back to Stellar's open source project would be entirely optional but still holds true to integrating the functionality out of the app layer.
To your below investigation into liquidity, I'm now curious how Fireblock interoperates with XLM to provide DeFi features as Compound does not support XLM (that I know of).
How is AnchorUSD able to offer those features on XLM and the other tokens they host and Compound doesn't and without it?",1610332566,1610350566,1/10/2021 21:36,1

Definitely the missing link I was looking for. I'll go back and edit some other posts in this thread now that this becomes clearer. Exactly why I love Reddit for this stuff.
My assumption was that AnchorUSD was leveraging an element of Stellar to natively handle the staking, margin trading and (eventual) stock tokenization of assets. After digging into this more it looks like they're combining essentially ALL of Fireblock's capability including DeFi.
Definitely need to do more digging now as it slightly worries me that the best user facing functions of AnchorUSD are in fact not powered by Stellar and instead (in my eyes) in-secure platforms (PoW)....down the rabbit hole I go.",1610331487,1610349487,1/10/2021 21:18,1

TA is drowned out by the overwhelming signals of buying trends and volumes of btc that Alts as an asset class sit directly under and collect on the waterfall of capital inflow. Alts Have been tethered to BTC since day one.  when the market cap expands there is just more money and speculation that waterfalls in.  Following floors and ceilings is useless when there are 130 percent gains out of nowhere. The only thing that matters is time in the market to allow fundamentals of the entity to evolve at this point.  What value to society does this project create?  No one seems to be talking about that on a long horizon. Almost every comment above is related to short term pops and appears juvenile and short sighted as a whole. I wonder how many newbs can talk about maturation of cross border payments or the business pursuits of stellar orgs board of advisors or the tangibles the company has brought to the table since inception. What does immediate liquidity actually mean for small business in Nigeria or other emerging markets that use stellar networks? What are competitors?

3582,3582,HalfwayHornet,"I can try, but im not great with explaining, and im just an average guy that doesn't really know what he's talking about. So keep that in mind lol.  As far as how long, who knows? I think that really depends on how long it takes for crypto to be come more popular in general.  XLMs value is in the service it provides, so until more are using that service, the value cant grow.
As far a long term price,  I completely disregarded market cap and all that that most people usually go of.  Why?  Because if you had told someone that BTC would have over 700 billion market cap 10 years ago they would have called you an idiot.  I looked at it backwards, if that makes sense.  A transaction cost .00001 lumen, or 1 lumen can do 10,000 transactions. So the price of 1 lumen comes from the cost of a transaction multiplied by the amount of transactions it can perform.  That means right now, a transaction cost approximately  .00003 cents, you could do 10,000 transactions for 1 lumen, or .30 cents.  I think that is super, super, super cheap.  So I asked myself, in the long term what is the price of a transaction at which making a transaction using XLM is not worth the cost?  Keep in mind, the financial institutions can still charge whatever they want, but they'll want to make a profit while still remaining cheap. So let's use that $100 number from before.  For a lumen to be worth $100, how much would a transaction cost?  1 cent.  Thats it.  But can a financial institution still profit from that? I think so, because it will cost 1 cent to send $1, but it will also only cost 1 cent to send $1,000,000.  They could charge a fraction of a percent in fees and still make money.  
This is not financial advice, thank you for coming to my Ted talk.  Cant wait to hear how dumb I am lol",1610316265,1610334265,1/10/2021 17:04,1
3583,3583,onthesunnysideofthe,"no one is answering you because there's not a good answer to your question. there's no cut and dry answers in financial markets like this. its unlikely this bull run is over, this is a **normal and healthy pullback. xlm is still up aprx. 150 % over last 2months.** assets don't go up endlessly forever 
instead of posting here and being upset about not getting answers, use the tools you have at your disposal (google, trading view, and historic discussions from this sub and other subs) to inform yourself about market fundamentals (things that are applicable *both* to crypto and the conventional stock market). This is how I gained proficient understanding in both crypto and stock asset management (though I have a financial manager at Goldman Sachs, its crucial to understand these matters fully for yourself). 
If you do this, the initial just basic ""you really should know this shit"" level of understanding could take maybe 2 hours, but some of the intuitive stuff w/ respect to market movements can obviously take much longer. Like with anything **you get in what you put out.** So of course, posting **is a big crash coming** on this sub is not putting in a lot and therefore won't yield you an answer that satisfies you or otherwise improves your bottom line financially w/ respect to your crypto holdings. 
Not trying to be harsh. I've been in crypto since 2016 and made *a lot* of stupid mistakes. Thought I was a genius in the first bull market / bull run of 2017, because everyone feels that way in a bull market. But I was patient and kept tabs on crypto for the last 3 years, continued to educate myself, focused on conventional asset management in my stock portfolios, etc. 
&amp;#x200B;
You can do the same, and it will greatly benefit you. I feel that when it comes to learning new things in the modern day - whether its learning to shred on the electric guitar or learning about financial asset trading / management, **google is the single most valuable resource that any human has ever had. its truly magnificent and do not take it for granted!**

So why do their values per unit seem so tied together? What is the reason that XLM seems to have a hard time surpassing XRP in value despite the solid press, bright individuals surrounding the project, honesty of the project, and what seems like an inevitable future use-case (not to mention the pending suit against Ripple)?
I hold a bag of both with the intention of holding long so I‚Äôm not looking to incite discussion on why one might be superior to the other rather than a discussion on why one (XLM specifically) has not superseded the other yet given the recent press for both.

3662,3662,pjd2011,"What you mention makes no sense at all. 
Every token created is a fork of whatever Blockchain they choose. Any Ethereum token is a fork of at least the primary layer to be on Ethereum's network and any features not included on Ethereum are a result of its token's customization. It can be easily exchanged with other Ethereum based tokens because it at least shares the base code to remain tied onto the platform. If they adjusted this base component then they'd no longer be ERC-20 compliant and therefore their own network.
The benefit to remaining compliant is native transactions on said larger network (Ethereum).
 It's the same thing here with Stellar only that Stellar's primary ERC-20 tokens are regulated entities that use Stellar's base. That's why the primary net and DEX's showing it are so small and other tokens such as AnchorUSD's assets include more than Stellar's base. 
Pathways and Atomic Swaps will allow these secondary assets to be exchanged but always use the regulated Anchor as the middle layer (invisible in UIs) to handle compliance.
Compare this to other Blockchains and those different swaps lose an audit trail and do not give Governments the power to enforce taxes and other applicable laws.
The base layer is the most critical and why it's so important for any project to choose their layer wisely as that's what maintains all compliance and usage.",1610301254,1610319254,1/10/2021 12:54,1

So with margins on AnchorUSD against tokens that are not on Stellar as an actual Anchor, XLM is transacted for said asset and then utilize their smart contract system which may or may not be Stellar's itself. 
If the asset was native to Stellar, you would capture more of whatever that asset is as it would only take Stellar's low cost transaction fee hit.

You can margin against nearly any Crypto they support. 
Although AnchorUSD is its own token/anchor, they just use what Stellar open sources (hence, why margin only appeared after Stellar created it). Or alternatively, they created it and then shared it back to Stellar and Stellar is using what they created. Either way it's out there.
They're also about to launch Stock trading which will also be taking full advantage of these feature sets.
Because it's Stellar/XLM, all trades have the audit trail required for regulatory compliance. Think of it as Robinhood but whereas Robinhood is centralized and has to handle it's own compliance (error prone), AnchorUSD will instead have XLM's compliance natively giving it a leg up.

3750,3750,TRossW18,"The only thing that really separates any of the blockchains are their consensus mechanisms. Cardano is PoS and Stellar uses a federated byzantine agreement called the SCP. They are completely different. 
Cardano requires staking to secure the network and properly reach consensus. It is an incentive structure. Stellar does not. Stellar assumes that 3rd parties are innately incentivized to act as validators without payment. Afterall, if your building an application on Stellar the security of the network is imperative to your success. 
There isnt a single blockchain that has proven to scale yet but many theorize they can-- others have proven to have scaling issues. Whether they *actually* can or not will likely depend on their consensus mechanism.
In terms of PoS, the long-term economics of it are somewhat questionable (unknown may be a better word). In order for the network to reach consensus, 1/3 of all issues coins (or maybe just ADA?) need to be staked. In order to get people to stake these networks have to offer lucrative interest--otherwise why would you stake? However, that puts the safety of the network in direct competition with the applications built on the network.Ie, In order to guarantee enough staking, you have to provide better rewards than the 3rd party applications, but if the network offers the best rewards why would people use many of the 3rd parties being built?

It's just that it's likely that, since XLM is the hub, there will be maximum liquidity between XLM and everything else vs USD&lt;-&gt;EURO, so most transactions will go through XLM.

For future references, the world is huge, do not claim that XRP has no future or Stellar is the only one to succeed or it does it better. You will end up sounding like what people claim in the Cardano subreddit. They are heavily delusion'ed to think Bitcoin &amp; Cardano will be the only 2 Cryptos that will survive. Any mention that claims otherwise would either get you banned or heavily downvoted. Yes I know they are totally nuts.
This world is large enough to sustain multiple Crypto Blockchain Platforms. Personally I see XRP &amp; XLM as the for fronts to achieving something no other crypto will. No Bank, Financial Institutions or Company will use an ""Unregulated"" Decentralized Blockchain like Ethereum for DEFI that already gotten hacked multiple times. For DeFi to succeed, its going to have to be Regulated by various Country Governmental bodies, as to gain the trust from the big money. XRP &amp; XLM are the 2 that are most trustworthy to accomplish this. IMO

Banks used to make interest on Nostro/Vostro accounts in the past, despite the changes in Fiat currency rates. But for years now with 0% interest rates &amp; fiat volatilities, Banks are losing $$$ keeping Trillions in Nostro/Vostro accounts.

Sure, that algo would manage break down an order into smaller entries or create a hidden bid wall, etc. This has nothing to do with stop hunting though, why did you mention this?
&gt;I've admitted there are very specific scenarios where technicals can be used which is completely irrelevant to the context of the conversation lol. This isn't a research paper so I didn't intend for my words to be taken in absolute terms when I thought it was pretty clear in which context we are referring to.
It's a disagreement, so it saves everyone time if you're concise and convey your point clearly. What do you think the context of the conversation is? You mentioned that TA is useless, that's all we've talking about.
&gt;There are consistantly profitable retail investors who make decisions based on internet memes that's just a probabilistic occurrence.
It seems you've gone from saying 'TA is useless' to 'TA is useful for some things' to 'TA can be used to trade probabilistically', despite comparing it to a trading plan based on memes lol. There's no 100% success rate trading style, so I'm not sure what your point is. FA can be just as wrong, even for the same reasons.
&gt;Feel free to point me to groups whos are consistantly outperforming random guesses.
Any profitable fund that has a TA team... any prop trading firm...
&gt;There just no consistent past pricing data that consistently predicts what's going to happen.
That's true for any trading style. You could even be right and still lose money, that's the nature of the beast.
&gt;That is, again, unless you can manipulate the market, have informational advantages over the market, speed performance over the market, or algos that can front run and make millions of decisions in fractions of a second.
Those trading styles come with their own risk, mainly hardware. There's no risk free trading style. This has nothing to do with TA man.",1610248226,1610266226,1/9/2021 22:10,0

3955,3955,hairyblackhole,"&gt; One example being simple USD$ inflation
I could but I don't think it's necessary. If USD inflates 3% per year and XLM only went up 3% per year, then I don't make any real profit. To model the price in nominal terms this is obviously necessary, but to model it in 2021 USD I don't think it is.
&gt; run your model on BTC, ETH
I don't think this is a good model for BTC. I build this model valuing XLM through its ability to be used as a means of exchange. BTC doesn't do that well. I'd build a BTC model valuing it as a store of value.

The reality is as more and more assets are added to the network, the true value price will always be in flux with the given aggregate of all asset's values attached to said network. If an attached asset collapses (such as a gov coin) then XLM will reflect that in real time compared to the other assets on network.
You're using USD as a basis and, instead, need to view it as XLM relative to all else. USD reference price may be much lower than, say, EUR reference price and that's a reflection of USD's global stance, not XLM.

The bottom of this range, aside from being the level where fundamentals caught market interest, was a critical resistance (now support) level.
The top of the range is open for debate, but it's likely XLM sees consolidation below $0.40 for a few weeks (trying to be rational). In addition to the major support at $0.12, there's another major support level at $0.20.

Volume is the total value traded in a 24h period. 
Volume higher than market cap doesn't necessarily mean anything, it doesn't cause anything to happen -- it just usually means there's lots of volume. Like if you and I invented our own currency, and there was only 10 of them, but we traded 30 total coins in one day, that doesn't mean anything other than we traded a lot. Volume is just how liquid or how active something is. Generally for volume you compare it to an average day to see how much more trading there is that day.

Nonetheless, as I partly hold XRP in my portfolio I hope it goes up. I look at coins that have yet to make a bull run and invest in that and then sell at the top for guaranteed profit. Yes one day I will cry because I missed the 10X but atleast I'm not losing money.

It‚Äôs best to keep the fee as low as possible so everyone wants to keep using the network. The more transactions the network processes the more the network is worth. Next to this the transaction fees are burnt. 
So when there are massive amounts of transactions being made the price of lumens will naturally rise as less lumens remain in circulation.
This will result in lowering the fee in lumens to transact to keep the network attractive to use.
Businesses spend massive amounts on transaction fees and would be happy to cut costs, remittances are also very expensive.
10,000 transactions of 1 billion or 1 dollar will still result in a total costs of 0.32 usd cents today. Now just google how much a creditcard transaction costs a business today to understand how cheap it is.",1610061129,1610079129,1/7/2021 18:12,1

Depends what you mean by valuable commodity. Will it rival Bitcoin's price per coin. Emphatic no.
Will it 10x? 50x? 100x? 500x? I don't know, but it would be great.
Changes to fees/reserves come down to the decentralized vote by the community. If the community rejects changing it, the sponsored reserve function and fee bumps function (aka a third party funding your wallet minimums and transaction fees) can still allow those in poverty to participate in the network.",1610050882,1610068882,1/7/2021 15:21,1

Bitcoin doesn't 'need' to be $40k to function as a decentralized medium of exchange, it is because supply and demand plus scarcity. All those same things can apply to XLM except that there is also a utility for it on the network. That's why I think it's reasonable to think it will increase in value. Obviously just my opinion.

5330,5330,ExactStart,"One of the great things about cryptocurrencies is that it's programmable. It runs on code that is constantly improved and adapts to the needs to the community. It's decentralized, so the nodes need to vote on updates, but if there are specific needs that are going to destroy the integrity of the network, I would imagine they would come together and implement that changes. If the value of XLM goes up, the fee can be adjusted down if it becomes cost prohibitive for the volume of transactions. It was discussed among developers a while ago if fees should be increased since it wasn't adequately preventing network spam, so it's something that they think about. If the fact that it's deflationary becomes a problem and scarcity is going to cause problems for the network/community, the inflation mechanism can be turned back on. 
The token is sexy because it will grow and change with the network, so it should theoretically never make itself obsolete. We're still very early. The model SDF has described in the past is something similar to the Linux Foundation where there are memberships and constantly updating, optimizing, and improving the code base.

5332,5332,LeBurntToast,"This just represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the network. It's a payment network. Let's use Ukraine as an example since they plan on using the Stellar network.
Ukraine will release a stable coin that has a 1:1 with their national currency. Its a digital currency that will operate on the stellar network. Transactions are nearly instant and basically free. The fee is relative to the price of .00001 lumen since that's what is burned to perform a transaction. With there being 20 billion lumens, that's 200 trillion transactions. For reference, Visa is 185 billion a year. So there are plenty of lumens to run the network for a very long time.
Lumens can also function as a currency on their own, as the speed of the network makes this a viable option. As for why anybody would adopt this, that's the whole point of development.

But by going into an Anchor's network you become compliant and then use their ledger to trace all taxable events, etc. Even if you converted to BTC or Monero (if any would even offer it) to transfer out to another non-Stellar network, there'd always be a record of how much you purchased.",1610043248,1610061248,1/7/2021 13:14,0
5478,5478,pjd2011,"Nope, not the inflation pool. And you're right it's AnchorUSD but I imagine they're either leveraging Stellar's native functionality to provide it and/or building it and providing it back to the broader community like other Stellar initiatives which means lower barrier to entry for others to create similar functionality.
Any token built on top of the network can use those features, just inside their own token. Its showcasing the viability of features using the network, inside a smaller network.
Once more Anchors come online the same activity you see on AnchorUSD would now be the broader ecosystem's but only for Fiat Anchors. 
Check out the general Stellar ledger activity compared to StellarX (Primary). Stellar is handling significantly more transactions that aren't on StellarX. 
This would be by design as each anchor requires KYC and the regulatory aspect. 
Yes, you can have a Stellar wallet on your own and bank yourself but you will only be able to trade into FIAT. You'll have to use a sub-token for other trading which keeps the network in full compliance.

5521,5521,pjd2011,"Nope! You earn interest just like other staking protocols are now trying to promote. It's been part of Stellar for awhile now.
When you enter the network on AnchorUSD for example your money shows USD in their FDIC backed (a bit of loophole but still insured!) account. It's actually their AnchorUSD token. 
Just having your money in that account is currently yielding nearly 8% interest. It's that high because most of the market is inside other assets like XLM or BTC which have lower interest rates (low as 2.8%) so the higher interest rate is to incentivize you to move money into USD and thereby keeping liquidity.
As people move out of these other assets and into USD the interest rate will reflect in real time while the other assets also adjust. 
Compare this, again, to the modern banking industry. You may have $XXX money in your bank account but are you telling me they keep ALL money in a vault? No, they pool the money into other investments to profit while keeping enough on-hand for withdrawls. Although we have FDIC in place, the banks use your money to make more money behind the scenes.

Looking at ETH, ETH 2.0, Compound and other DeFi companies...they have great products and yield the consumer benefit along the lines of the above. However, you have to be savvy enough to use it. 
The field of UX or user experience shows that simple is king. Why go elsewhere to have benefits when you can simply have a single place for all action?
These other decentralized tokens and systems have been great at yielding proof of concepts and prove that these things work. However, I just can't imagine being OK with billions and perhaps trillions of eventual assets sitting on a platform that you or any institution can 100% say is secure.
ETH 2.0 and Bitcoin layer 2's may have introduced staking and improved transactions but the missing piece is the most glaring, the base layers of these systems are vulnerable and, likewise, introduce risk to the most risk-adverse industry in existence. 
 If you're going to power the future of finance and hold your life savings somewhere; don't you want to know that there's people supporting said network and back it?
Why re-invent the old finance system on blockchain when you can fundamentally re-imagine it as something better? That in a nutshell is why I've always been a Stellar supporter.",1610040344,1610058344,1/7/2021 12:25,1

5532,5532,SnooKiwis9023,"A little word of advice. Don't chase XRP!!! What you are seeing are shorts closing out of there positions before delisting. Remember if you are short you cant close out of the position. 
Just my opinion
Be very careful.",1610040027,1610058027,1/7/2021 12:20,1
5533,5533,pjd2011,"Haha, it's complex, right!? Completely different way to think about operations but once it starts to click it makes you realize how ""dumb"" other systems are. 
My understanding is that you would receive the lowest price available given what transactions are out there on the ledger. Because XLM is hidden from sight on a user interface, the benefit would be reflected in whatever FIAT is used. 
To your example above...once Stellar has a full blown network with many assets there may be multiple XLM transactions taking place to create the liquidity for another transaction to take place. 
Everything from fractions of tokenized securities, other FIAT, tokenized Metals, you name it will all be in use in this system as possible pathways to unlock liquidity in realtime and ensure transactions occur.
This is where that fairness piece comes along and why it will be near impossible to build any legacy finance type opportunity on the protocol itself; it does these things automatically to keep a level playing field and passes on returns in the form of staking or keeping your assets in the market for others to continually use and likewise further increase liquidity.
It's really the full automation of the financial system allowing us, the users, to reap the rewards that financial institutions have been reserving for themselves or those educated enough to profit from.
Think about why interest rates on traditional savings accounts are so low. Think about all the overhead a bank has running its business. This automates the need for traditional banking structures and we receive the interest or ROI of market action directly. Someone with $5 in their account yields the exact same interest level as someone with $1M in the bank.",1610039697,1610057697,1/7/2021 12:14,1

Take a look at amazon or apple, the ground floor pricing on stocks was cheap... but this was a company you were investing in, you were investing in something tangible. BTC is an idea, a number, an algorithm... The very concept of investing in something like this is new, and won't be seen again. The .com boom was much more tangible in a sense. So while this growth seems insane, it's actually not. The human brain can't really feel numbers over a hundred, we can comprehend, study, and understand them, yes, but the idea that there are 7.8 billion people and 137million BTC users (actual number supposedly) doesn't feel very different from say I lied and there were 500 million users. The people and money flowing into crypto will be like nothing there ever was and these massive ""bubbles"" and 10000% gains will and should feel insane and out of the norm and cause ""red flags"" but in time we will look back as if it was obvious that this was the future and going to happen.",1610008117,1610026117,1/7/2021 3:28,0

5843,5843,matusvo,"If you're referring to people being sceptical about BTC's price then you can compare the market caps let's say of gold, the stock market etc. and make an estimate what's in the realm of possibilities.
BTC is nearly 700B$.
Gold roughly 10 Triliion(!)$ 
So that's in the order of 10 times more. If you think that BTC will become bigger than gold in the next 10 years and use the formula MARKET_CAP = SUPPLY * PRICE you end up with an estimated price of BTC around 500k$. 
XLM market cap is currently 8.5B$
That's in the order of 100 less than BTC right now. Again you can make some crude price predictions depending on how will XLM compare to BTC or other crypto in the future. ETH is 137B, XLM with that market cap would be over 5$. XLM with current BTC market cap would be roughly 28$.
So I think that single digit dollar prices for XLM might be possible in the next few years. Double digits in the next 5-10 years. Triple digits much later and depending on the adoption.

I bought roughly $500 USD worth of XLM and transferred it to a different wallet. I transferred 10 and then 20 XLM to make sure it was the right wallet, etc. I then transferred 3456 XLM (the new XLM plus some air drops from Keybase) and the app just said ""Error."" I checked and the transaction is not on the chain and never reached my wallet. Additionally I keep checking the transaction in AnchorUSD and it just says ""Transaction ID Pending.""   
All of this happened a couple days ago. Since then I've been unable to find anyone in their support channels via either email or the chat in the app itself. At this point I'm fairly certain I just lost all those coins to their profit.

6081,6081,pjd2011,"1) I definitely need to work on my explanation for this one! Good catch.
Stability in terms of a seller in Fiat I should say. A person selling something for say, $100 may be 100 XLM in one transaction and 99 XLM the next. The seller would still receive $200 (as they conduct biz in USD) but the XLM beneath the transaction correspond with the state of all attached Anchors at the given transaction time.
So you're right, XLM looks volatile when referenced against FIAT but in reality it's whatever the FIAT's fluctuation is relative to USD. Make sense?
Someone purchasing EUR elsewhere on the network could shift the relative value of XLM in real-time moving its peg against USD which would be the reason for the difference in XLM value behind the scenes (Unknown to seller because why care?). 
This is why XLM will always be a combined view of the global marketplace with each XLM constantly balancing between all combined anchors. It will always be moving vs FIAT but it will always keep the same value in-network.
2) It comes down to the ""fairness"" aspect. If someone say in Africa spends 5    
DZD (Algeria) on, say, an Apple. That would reflect 5 XLM on the network. 
That transaction would amount to 5 XLM because the aggregate ""fair"" value of the DZD-Anchor, USD-Anchor, Ukraine Anchor, etc deems it as such by looking at the XLM value relative to all other assets. 
5 XLM in the DZD-Anchor would be the same relative value of an Apple purchased for $1 in the USA based on the ledger knowing XLM's value relative to USD. The conversion rate for DZD to USD would then be 5:1 at the time of transaction.",1609985814,1610003814,1/6/2021 21:16,1

However, you could use AnchorUSD's platform to trade into Tether and several other tokens not natively on Stellar. That would be using AnchorUSD's custom token (Built on Stellar) to go cross-chain with various other tokens. 
Because AnchorUSD uses Stellar, they likewise have all the benefits of the core Stellar platform such as Audit logs but can also customize it (Additional pairs, stock trading coming soon and other ""pro"" features) not baked into the full Stellar network. They're their own DEX using some of Stellar's native features mixed with their own.
This is the benefit to crypto projects building on Stellar. You have the full ability to build your own customizations on top and if you want to transfer to another DEX, simply convert to XLM and use XLM to buy into another DEX's stablecoin and trade from there.
This is why it's so compliant with regulators and where XLM's value stems from. Being able to go from a USD-Backed exchange into a EUR-Backed exchange with XLM being the compliant glue and Gov or private Stablecoins being the source of truth for trades in whatever jurisdiction. For the USA this means every compliant exchange or institution would be an Anchor on the primary network with trading or other transactions happening on top of them and only XLM handling the institution to institution (or gov) transactions and keeping an audit trail of the movement. 
What you're looking into doing although possible ; is exactly what regulation is looking to put an end to. This is why only accredited Anchors are on the primary network controlled by the foundation. Compliance is everything for adoption and opening that up goes against it's primary selling point.

Actually at that moment I thought great, there will obviously be an auto-market making feature on some DEX, that is natively integrated into the underlying protocol, but I must be confused.
I'll have to read up more. I don't understand some fundamentals I guess. Just speaking from my experience on StellarX. (1) It appears the relative value of XLM is incredibly variable itself, AND with massive differences against even stablecoins like USDT, or billex USD, (where for example I saw USDT trade at 1.4 yesterday, while Billex remained .98) so I don't understand what you mean by calling it stable. I guess I just don't understand the pathfinding at all as it relates to the DEX. Who does it benefit, the buyer or the seller?

6236,6236,pjd2011,"My aunt actually wrote the leading book on Arbitrage within our legacy financial systems!
I looked into doing this on Stellar way back in 2017 and quickly realized that at its core SCP eliminates most opportunities as the protocol itself uses arbitrage to ensure fairness among all transactions on the network and a primary reason why it's such an incredible feat!
As more and more usage occurs on the network the protocol itself will find arbitrage opportunities and transact them via pathways which means a large transaction across two currencies could result in several other transactions across multiple currencies (tokens) that allow the primary to occur. 
This keeps XLM's relative value across the network stable and why Fiat prices will always fluctuate as they're the volatile asset; not XLM.
This is why most exchanges built on Stellar haven't found success. They fundamentally go against what the protocol does and where it's so exciting as a platform as it automates these finance system ""hacks"" so that people unaware of them can still receive the benefits.
Check out how the Consensus Protocol works. There's a great Stanford hosted video on Youtube somewhere. It highlights the above in a much better way than my words can! üòÇ",1609979225,1609997225,1/6/2021 19:27,1

Ultimately better tech will be used on top of Stellar as far greater minds have come into the game to achieve better systems that scale on a case by case basis but its the SCP that ultimately gives way to Stellar being the best base to build from.

6413,6413,pjd2011,"What's even more impressive is when you look at the experience Jed McCaleb gained at Mt Gox. Living that ""failure"" firsthand is what allowed him to find a better way to manage these large systems.
Mt Gox was a historic failure of what happens when you try and manage blockchain tech with centralized systems in much the same way that Banks operate under today.
His tech at Ripple was the start of this but he understood that in order for the true value to come forth, an open platform is the way to go. This follows all open source success stories.
I don't find it a coincidence that Binance emerged using its BNB token around the same time Ripple and Stellar emerged. The BNB token and likewise, Binance are powered by the same type of technology that Stellar has and continues to improve upon.
BNB allows Binance to utilize the power of blockchain to maintain its exchange vs Coinbase and (previously) Mt Gox had to scale using legacy methods which are far more costly and lack compliance (unless invested in).   
Other platforms and tokens may have certain advantages over Stellar but as a core platform, you're not going to find someone with more experience and intellect to architect solutions that simply work.",1609968146,1609986146,1/6/2021 16:22,1

The difference with the Stellar/ USDC move is much more significant than most might think - in my opinion.
USDC is set to take the majority of volume from USDT in my opinion (and i dont say this lightly) it will become the primary stablecoin before long you watch!
Do a little looking into the sequence of events over the past year.
Circle abandoned their trading business including the sale of Poloniex not very long after buying them out. This is just my own speculation but just the fact that they did so to change course into becoming ""THE"" U.S. $ backed stablecoin, followed by the recent announcements from the OCC in regards to banking and stablecoins, in addition to the many obvious connections / relationships between Circle, Coinbase, and Stellar tells me traction will be putting it mildly!",1609967779,1609985779,1/6/2021 16:16,1

For short term, it might be cooling off a bit. Usually when you see long wicks up like that, it could correct a bit, but there are times when it goes on another run again after cooling off,  but anything can happen.
It can also depend on BTC, if it pushes quickly to 40K, money could flow into that. If it crashes, XLM could dump with it. Best case scenario for XLM short term, is if BTC stagnates or moves up slowly and people want to move to other coins like XLM to get most profits.  Just my opinion.

No one could join, no one could transact, and they would have rendered their ""investment"" useless. That's cutting off your nose to spite your face.
More realistically, it becomes a case of supply and demand. The owners have a price they will sell at. Buyers have a price they will buy at.  Now they just have to negotiate.
But yeah, your math assumes that I and everyone else will sell their XLM for $0.10, which is a poor assumption.",1609959764,1609977764,1/6/2021 14:02,0

Anyways, I don't think folks get why Jed actually left Ripple. From my knowledge, it was due to disagreements on the direction of the other execs and what Jed was envisioning. He left and obviously founded Stellar - a **non-profit** ... and he made sure XLM was actually utilized on the Stellar blockchain. Lots of other differences as well, but man, I just find it mind boggling sometimes.

6786,6786,PickingUnicorns,"Hey,
Thanks for the reply. The article shows the Metcalfe's law, where the value of a network becomes more valuable as the amount of endpoints increases. Imagine a telephone network with only 1 phone, you can only call 1 person. Now imagine a network with 100 phones. Now you can call 100 people, which is way more valuable. The same is true for the Stellar network. As more fiat currencies are represented on the protocol, the value of the network increases. You will be able to pay with XLM, while your friend receives USD, EUR, PESO or even Bitcoin.
As the network grows, the utility of XLM grows as well. People expect that more people will hold XLM as a result (to pay for fees, minimum balances, but also to transact with as it is the only asset that doesn't require trustlines in the netwrok).
As the price increases the network does not become more costly. The fees can be decreased if needed. Fees will always hold a balance between:
* High enough to prevent network spam
* Low enough to enable micro transactions  
XLM has a fixed supply as well by the way. You could view XLM as the bitcoin of the network. The advantage that XLM has over bitcoin is that it is interoperable with other kinds of value like fiat. Which as explained let's you pay XLM, while your friend receives USD in the bank.",1609948309,1609966309,1/6/2021 10:51,1

7126,7126,Asum_chum,"First I‚Äôd like to say good luck to everyone involved in the Stellar project. I bought in at average .44 back in 2017/18, watched it run up and slowly bleed out with the rest of the market. 
I was interested in stellar for a few reasons. I liked the fact it was non profit and I‚Äôve also lived and worked abroad and having had to lose a fair bit of money exchanging currencies.
I‚Äôve followed closely and had been quite active for a long time on this sub. I got into many stellar based projects and I see that it has the possibility of a decent future but with time I‚Äôve come to realise that Bitcoin is the future for me and my family. I‚Äôm not in it completely for the money but it helps in life. I love what this technology can offer the future. I hate the banking world and their selfish, egotistical idiocies and I hate governments that bend over backwards to support them.
I decided to sell at about .16 a couple of weeks ago. I‚Äôd hedl for 3 years and even rode it up in 2018 to my break even but I made my entire initial investment back when bitcoin hit $25,100. Maybe I‚Äôll be back in the future but at present I don‚Äôt see it being anything else but bitcoin for me.
Thank you for teaching me so much about things I couldn‚Äôt comprehend previously. I wish you all the best of luck for the future.",1609938494,1609956494,1/6/2021 8:08,0

2/I will never sit as the beneficiary of what feels like a scam. I was never happy with ripple having so many xrp but the same is true for stellar and several other top crypto. They all annoy me and when Stellar holds 60% of a pre mined currency whether they give them away or sell them it's all done to promote Stellar and the price of xlm will directly benefit Stellar because they have owned most of them from the very beginning!
So I say no to dirty money. I will stay out of any coin that is similar to these until further clarification from the SEC or other regulations. RIght now it looks like the SEC, even if inadvertently have just handed a success to the Stellar and focused on RIpple. Just for me that's dirty money. You can say I am a hypocrite but I am not , I just wanted the law or regulations upgraded and clearly layed out, and not retrospectively so there is a level playing field for all these crypto projects. I believe xrp is the better currency as what ripple are doing is much more advanced than stellar. I would rather lose on making that wrong call than have the SEC sue my rival lol, it's pathetic.

This company called Stellar magically appears having most of the xlm, maybe they give away, maybe they burn who knows? they can do what they want but for me it's potentially an unregistered security. Why do you think coinbase waited so long to list them?? they listed them the same time as xrp right?
You are benefitting from the SEC actions , it's a pathetic way to win on an investment in my opinion.
Stellar did have an ico in 2014 raising 39 million why are they not being sued by the sec for this? Even airdrops are designed to promote and help Stellar they have a clear vested interest in the price and success of xlm? right?

7343,7343,DistributedFutures,"Ignore the moonshot estimates, but a few observations about price that I think are entirely reasonable:
1) Previous all-time BTC ratio would put XLM at around $2 - so I think that could be possible in the next few months.
2) XLM was once a Top 3 token and I think given it's adoption taking place over the next year it is likely to reach this again - that would mean that a 100bn+ market cap ($5) is readily feasible.
3) Over the next decade, if BTC becomes Gold 2.0 and the digitisation of national currencies continues and we see the *public*  ledger used internationally then a $1tn market cap is potentially plausible ($50).
Personally, my guess would be that we hit $2 this month; then the whole market is going to pull back as people realise pretty crazy profits and are worried about a repeat-2017/18 situation; then my EOY target for XLM would be $5 once people realise that the 'crash' won't be the same as before (as there are real fundamentals and strong institutional hands in the game now).

Where should a technology like this stand in terms of market cap? 40 billions, 400 billions or more? 
Now you do the math to see how much an XLM is worth? 
Stellar was undervalued and still is because the organisation doesn't focus too much on marketing like other cryptos out there. And even when they have big news, they don't sell it. 
In August, Stellar was invited in a panel discussion with the US Financial Technology Task Force. In that discussion the CEO pointed out that Stellar is not a security and probably wouldn't have been invited if it was: [https://stellar.org/blog/sdf-on-capitol-hill](https://stellar.org/blog/sdf-on-capitol-hill)
Also Stellar will be used for USDC starting this February: [https://stellar.org/blog/usdc-is-coming-to-stellar](https://stellar.org/blog/usdc-is-coming-to-stellar)
In my opinion, Stellar is very undervalued.
It's worth at least 40 billions, which is way above 1USD, close to 2 dollars.

I have been an XRP holder since late 2017 and thus, fortunately, I am still in profit (who knows for how long). I saw the january's '18 bull run and didn't sell a single coin (stupid me) and rode throughtout the bottom untill today.
When the SEC's hammer dropped on XRP the first thing I wanted to do was to switch every XRP to XLM, but I didn't do it because XLM as we know has been always correlated to XRP, and infact it dropped majorly. As a consequence, I was indifferent between holding either of the two.
During the last week I was really on the verge of switching everything to XLM again but I didn't have the courage. Today's I'm seeing XLM's pump and man I wish switched. Maybe after 3+ years I am too attached to XRP and I wish I wasn't because we're talking money here. 
I often see many people here hating on XRP, wishing its demise, wishing to be overturn and destroyed by XLM, honestly I don't understand that, as many of you here have or are still holding some XRP. Maybe it's too late for me to join XLM and it'll either be do or die with XRP for me. Wish you guys success and possibly we'll both meet on the moon.",1609926581,1609944581,1/6/2021 4:49,1

I really look forward to seeing what USDC can bring to us. 
Considering USDC is a regulatory-approved and fiat-backed stable coin with a 100% fiat currency collateral, perhaps USDC is the only one stable coin which has potential to create a ‚Äòreal‚Äô economic activity to the Stellar ecosystem. USDC, really, can stimulate the true economic demands both inside and outside the Stellar ecosystem. I‚Äôm thinking, If done well, it can even cause a paradigm shift. In the future, I don‚Äôt surprise if I see an e-commerce like Amazon offering the USDC payment option to those who don‚Äôt have a US dollar account or to those who are not in the US, and giving a Stellar address so that they can hold USDC, or I don‚Äôt surprise if I see a ‚ÄúUSDC Participating Store"" where I can simply pay in USDC without having a US dollar account in my bank through a Stellar app or ‚ÄúUSDC Participating Credit Card‚Äù via retail store‚Äôs payment devices which are connecting to the Stellar Network. It‚Äôs too much to asküòÖ? Once it becomes available even if only in the US, what we will have seen is a paradigm shift. I believe this can not be possible without the Stellar Network + USDC.
USDC has both a means of storing value and so much convenience for helping people all over the world in MANY WAYS! Stellar has a foresight.

[https://www.stellar.org/blog/protocol-13-improvements?locale=en](https://www.stellar.org/blog/protocol-13-improvements?locale=en)
‚ÄúFirst-class multiplexed accounts (CAP-27)
Protocol 13 also introduces a new type of account address that includes a built-in 64-bit memo. This change is important for exchanges and other custodial services that maintain a single deposit Stellar address and require memos in order to properly route payments to the correct user account in their internal databases. With these new multiplexed accounts ‚Äî muxed accounts for short ‚Äî custodial services can give each user their own account ID that routes to the underlying exchange Stellar address. 
In addition to making it impossible for users to forget required memos (a problem we came up with a temporary solution to recently), muxed accounts are robust against typos, which current memos are not.  They also allow you to apply memo-like functionality at the operation level, so you can bundle multiple payment operations to multiple muxed accounts into a single transaction, which is cleaner, more efficient, and better for the network than submitting transactions made of single payment operations.
And while memos can let you know which sub-account a payment should go to, they can't let you know which sub-account a payment came from. When a payment from a sub-account needs to be returned, for instance, there‚Äôs no way to navigate the last mile: the return may get to the custodial service, but they don't know whose account to credit.  By making it possible to identify the sending sub-account, muxed accounts make those kinds of returns easy.
The thing about the muxed accounts, however, is that while they're baked into Protocol 13, they're not actually accessible as of this writing.  We put in the wiring, but haven't added a switch.  Before muxed accounts are ready to use, we have to figure out the best way to expose them in Horizon and the Stellar SDKs, and that's going to take some thought, testing, and validation.  There's a proposal for how to do it ‚Äî SEP-23 ‚Äî and an ongoing discussion on Github.  If you want to see how it all shakes out ‚Äî or you have any thoughts about the best path forward ‚Äî please join the discussion!‚Äù",1609910379,1609928379,1/6/2021 0:19,1

XLM is also used as an intermediary trading asset when exchanging between different assets on the network and provide liquidity between trading pairs on the decentralized stellar exchange. 
Think of the assets listed on stellar as IOUS. For example, when USDC lists on stellar, it will essentially be an IOU for USD.  Initially, Circle will be the anchor - meaning they will hold the USD that backs up 1:1 the USDC listed on stellar. Soon after, other companies will also be anchors for USDT.  This will allow anyone developing on stellar to be able to use the established anchors for on/off ramping US dollars into and off of the stellar blockchain.

Most exchanges only have a single receiving address for XLM. When you click the deposit button, they'll tell you what memo to add to your deposit. This memo ID is unique to you, so when a deposit comes in with that unique ID, they automatically know who they should credit it to.
So when you send from your wallet, use the Memo ID field to paste your unique ID into, send a test amount first, and when they get it, they'll credit it to you.
If you forget your memo, you won't be the first. The XLM you sent will arrive at their address and they won't know who to credit it to. You will have to contact support and tell them you forgot your memo. Eventually, they'll get back to you (could be days could be weeks), and they'll have you prove you own the originating wallet (usually by sending another small transaction with some special code, kind of like a reverse SMS 2FA).

Considering USDC is a regulatory-approved and fiat-backed stable coin with a 100% fiat currency collateral (That‚Äôs the key!), currently USDC may be the only one stable coin which has the opportunity to create a ‚Äòreal‚Äô economic activity to the Stellar ecosystem. USDC, really, can stimulate the true economic demands both inside and outside the Stellar ecosystem. If done well, it can even cause a paradigm shift. In the future, I don‚Äôt surprise if I see an e-commerce like Amazon offering a USDC payment option to those who don‚Äôt have a US dollar account and giving a Stellar address to hold USDC for their customers, or I don‚Äôt surprise if I see a ‚ÄúUSDC Participating Store"" where I can simply pay in USDC without having a US dollar account in my bank through a Stellar app or ‚ÄúUSDC Participating Credit Card‚Äù via retail store‚Äôs payment devices which are connecting to the Stellar Network. 
These cannot be possible without USDC. A fiat-backed stablecoin has both a means of storing value and so much convenience in many ways for people all over the world!

We don‚Äôt even know how to really even value it yet. Will we value it based on utility? What is 100,000 transactions worth then? Will it be based on network usage, will market cap equal total value on the network or a percentage of it? We know in some form it is supply vs demand at its core. But speculation will inevitably exist in anything that can be traded globally. When we see real utility like with Ukraine and what Cowrie is doing in Nigeria.

The majority of the high TPS requirements would be on the stablecoin or asset built on top of Stellar. The only TX outside of this would be moving assets to another coin/service. 
Visa may TX 10k+/min but they handle significantly fewer money transfers to either pay or receive which would be the primary Stellar TPS.

72 countries, 47 currencies, 44 banking endpoints and more than 1081 unique currency trading pairs. IBM Blockchain World Wire is here.
In the last four weeks, we have had JPM Coin announcement by JP Morgan, followed by Facebook's ambitions to plug crypto payments into Whatsapp, and now IBM have announced the launch of World wire - a cross border payments platform on Stellar protocol. I tried to call them permissioned Blockchain, but couldn't resist calling them ""Centralized"".
When I blogged about JPM Coin a few weeks ago, and how it could affect both Ripple and SWIFT, one unanimous comment I received was that JPM Coin couldn't be considered a cryptocurrency. I have had several philosophical arguments over the years on why a permissioned Blockchain, preferred by enterprises, do not/do qualify as Blockchain as they are centralized.
For all practical reasons, we have seen the rise and fall of decentralized Blockchain. Most of us would like a utopian decentralized world without these too-big-to-fail firms throwing their weight around, or central regulators calling the shots, or tech giants monopolizing industries with their data might. However, it is hard to make the leap from a highly centralised system (we have today) to a new decentralised way - not just philosophically, but also pracically.
The focus has shifted from ICOs to the more conservative STOs, with stable coins showing up in most use cases. Several startups I have met in the last few months have even stopped using the term 'ICO'. The resurgence of Blockchain is now being led by big firms like IBM, Facebook and JP Morgan. I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes the norm in 2019, where we see more Blockchain based production use cases from enterprises.
IBM have been working in partnership with the Stellar Foundation for quite sometime now. When I spoke to Lisa Nestor, the Director of partnerships at Stellar in Q4 2018, she mentioned that they had a strategic partnership with IBM. She stressed the importance of working closely with incumbent organisations across industries to make Blockchain usage mainstream.
We've created a new type of payment network designed to accelerate remittances and transform cross-border payments to facilitate the movement of money in countries that need it most
Marie Wieck, General Manager, IBM Blockchain
As a result the IBM World wire, focused on the cross-border payments market has already enabled payment locations in 72 countries, with 48 currencies and 44 banking endpoints. It supports Stellar Lumens and a USD based stablecoin - thanks to their work with Stronghold. The network will also support stablecoins issued by several of its consortium banks. The list includes stablecoins based on Euro, Indonesian Rupiah, Philippine Peso, Korean Won and Brazilian Real. How will this affect Ripple?
Credit Ripple for the vision of using a digital asset in order to enact immediate settlement with finality. I think their implementation followed one path. Our implementation is a little bit different. We are not the issuer of an asset. In fact, what we believe is that there should be an ecosystem of a variety of digital assets that provide the settlement instruments that enable these cross-border payments.
Jesse Lund, IBM's VP of Blockchain and Digital currencies
IBM's strategy of keeping the platform agnostic to any kind of digital asset is a master stroke. The platform will work through the following steps,
‚Ä¢ Institution A chooses USD to execute a transaction with to Institution B in Euros
‚Ä¢ Institution A converts USD to XLM (or any other digital currency of their choice)
‚Ä¢ IBM Worldwire converts XLM to Euros and records the transaction on the Blockchain
‚Ä¢
The new world of international payments look pretty disintermediated, near real time and efficient. Bringing on-board new markets is cheaper; micro payments support and end to end transparency are all benefits too. Are we still going to be hung up on ""It is not really decentralized""? Do we care?
IBM World wire ‚Äì the inevitable rise of Centralized Blockchains
How can we get intelligent with the data around us and spot recessions? An analysis of Consumer data should provide us with a view on consumer behaviour, and almost predict where inflation would be heading. One of the firms I recently met, used open banking to collect consumers data, enrich it, and help them manage their finances. But the intelligence they gather from millions of transaction level data are used by their institutional clients to understand customer sentiments towards a brand.
Those insights combined with macro economic data should give these institutions the intelligence to choose their investments. The applications of open banking have largely been focused around selling services to customers in a personalized fashion. However, open banking data should help us understand where the economy is heading too.
Risk management functions in banks/FIs have been beefed up since the recession. About ¬£5 Billion is spent in the UK alone on risk and regulatory projects every year. The ability to perform scalable simulations in a Quantum computing ready world will help banks provide near real time risk management solutions.
In capital markets, we model the risk of a position by applying several risk factors to it. Often these risk factors are correlated to each other. To be able to model the effect of a dozen or more correlated risk factors on a firm‚Äôs position is hard for conventional computers. And as the number of these correlated risk factors increase, the computational power required to calculate risks increase exponentially. This is one of the key issues of simulations (not just in financial services) that Quantum computers are capable of solving.
11 years ago, when the recession happened, regulators were ill-equipped to react due to the lack of real time insights. Today they have regular reports from banks on transactions, and better ways to understand consumers‚Äô behaviour. That clubbed with macro economic data trends, should provide enough indicators for regulators to set policies. So, when there is a tax law that would trigger a collapse is being proposed, they should come up with strategies to bring the law into effect with minimal damage to the economy.
In the machine learning world, there are two different approaches ‚Äì supervised and unsupervised models. If you understand the problem well, you typically go for the supervised model and see how the dependent variable is affected by the independent variables.
It‚Äôs important for regulators and central banks to run exploratory analysis ‚Äì unsupervised models, and assess the patterns and anomalies that the algorithms throw.
Data from consumer behaviour, geo-political events, macro economics and the market should give these algorithms enough to identify patterns that bring about recessions. This may not necessarily help us avoid a recession, but could definitely reduce the impact of a sudden recession, or help us engineer a controlled recession when we want a cool down of the economy.",1609883512,1609901512,1/5/2021 16:51,0
8056,8056,onthesunnysideofthe,"I'm all for positivity but get nervous and unsettled I guess when I see comments that sort of blindly say ""HODL until this coin goes 500 X guaranteed in X timeframe"" 
It happens I'm quite bullish on stellar and have owned it since 2017 + never considered selling. But I'm sure those of us who've been around since 2017 remember that every ""altcoin"" subreddit was just comments saying HOLD to the moon and guaranteed giant gains. 
I believe that sort of mentality is what resulted in such a drawn out bear market, among others (e.g. 99% of projects being useless cash grabs). 
Now of course XLM increasing in value is great and would make me happy, but I'm just as content riding it down lower in value. I guess I just feel strongly its important not to make this too cultish or guaranteed gains / ""moon boy"" stuff, **because there are certainly large #'s of newcomers to XLM and crypto as a whole in this sub right now and we don't want to breed a pool of uninformed, unrealistic, and** ***irresponsible investors*** **who are going to expect / demand overnight gains.**

Stablecoins
World Wire subscribers transacted using bridge assets, many of which were stablecoins. Stellar makes issuing assets easy, and was built with stablecoins in mind.
Compliance
IBM World Wire piloted connecting larger-scale financial institutions to Stellar via a publicly-permissioned network.
Instant finality
The Stellar Consensus Protocol prevents forks, keeping all assets on one global ledger and allowing for immediate settlement of payments.
Scalability
The pilot sought to cover 72 countries and 47 currencies, requiring a network that can handle high transaction volumes relative to other blockchains.
Nonprofit

The market is looking for a next GRP for quick profits and they will put their bets on XLM. Meanwhile us HODLers will profit. This will go on for a bit. XLM will settle for a bit but it will remain high, it wont drop significantly, just until the time is right again and we will go up again.

Hey everyone, just wanted to hop in and give a quick state of the sub and make a quick comment with bullets.
1. Welcome to all the new community members that have been stopping by over the past few weeks. Please take a look at the subreddit rules when you have a moment. [https://reddit.com/r/stellar/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/stellar/wiki/rules)! Basically, don't attack people, try not to repost stuff already posted (same news from multiple sources), and please keep all speculation and price discussion in the Daily Chat thread.
2. Obviously automod is busted for the daily. This is because reddit deprecated the old system and replaced it with something not as... dynamic? Anyways, the new daily chat thread should be up around 12am CST but it won't have the dates in the title anymore. F's in the chat all around. We'll see how it looks tomorrow and tweak it when the sub goes up in flames. (kidding of course)
3. I'd like to thank all of the community moderators and volunteers who have been helping out since this subreddit's inception. The time is coming again where the sub may need to start looking for community volunteers to join the community mod effort. If you're interested, shoot me a DM. Otherwise, stay tuned for the eventual meta discussion about it.

My original question was prompted by https://stellar.expert/explorer/public showing only about 13k accounts active per day, about 90% down
I‚Äôve  since looked at coin metrics which shows about 150k-200k active accounts, but this is lower than the ATH (the article might well explain this) and has basically been flat for a year. In comparison BTC is showing large growth.
I know transaction volumes are growing, but looking to understand why that would be happening without the growth of accounts - as I can‚Äôt make sense of it I assume I‚Äôm misunderstanding something.",1609876387,1609894387,1/5/2021 14:53,1

I owned both XRP and XLM prior to the run in 17 as well.  I ended up selling the XRP.  What never sat right with me was Ripple, the company, was touting all these new partnership and people were going nuts.  But when you read the fine print, companies were using ripples products and the products didn‚Äôt necessarily require any XRP to be used.  It all seemed a little less than transparent to me at the time.  So I bounced, bought even more XLM and never looked back.  Anyway.....",1609876116,1609894116,1/5/2021 14:48,0

I owned XRP pre 2017 bull run. Rode it all the way up and all the way down.
Came across stellar and saw it had similar goals and use case. First bought around .30 and kept DCAing until it hit like 0.10 and then I got tired of losing money.
I‚Äôd been kicking myself for months as XRP tripled again recently from my buy price (0.20) while stellar was up closer to 50% from my buy price.
Buying stellar seemed to be a less productive hedge against XRP and then boom the lawsuit drops and now XLM is creeping up on XRP.
The only thing I feel good about is the use case for these two coins. Personally I think Ripple has a quicker path to getting XRP adoption but this lawsuit is a wrench in things.
At the end of the day I hope one of these two win and wins big!!",1609875611,1609893611,1/5/2021 14:40,0

8234,8234,Tango1777,"So what you're Polish? I am, too, we have nothing to do with Ukraine nor we have any more knowledge about them than any other country and its citizens... WTF ""I'm Polish"" is supposed to be, a factor here? You're kidding?! That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard to support a theory. Ukraine is the only official name and NO alternatives exist and it's in their DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. The Ukraine was a part of Soviet Union back in the days (The Ukraine Soviet Socialistic Republic) so it was called with 'the' because of that when it was within Soviet Union. But it's not anymore. And if you're a Pole, you should know very well that countries don't want to be linked to Russia in any way based on historical reasons, especially countries like Poland or Ukraine. So no, they don't just PREFER to be called Ukraine, that's the ONLY correct form to call their country and those who are aware the difference in English will for sure point it out and feel like you're suggesting they're still somewhat Russian property. Would you like someone to tell you that Poland is a property of Russia, huh? Mr. ""they can prefer whatever they want"" or an ""idiot"", in short? It's not grammatically correct either, grammar doesn't affect proper names in any way. Just like in many other languages, including Polish, there are no rules and proper names can even include grammar mistakes like Pszczyna city which is grammatically incorrect yet that's how you spell it. And no, the USA is always the USA and that is always correct. There is less formal usage of USA only e.g. when a name is supposed to be as short as possible e.g. on stamps or ""made in usa"". But overall it's THE USA because it has to specify which states you're talking about, there can be more states in America than within the country called the USA. This is not a perfect example since America is also widely used as the USA name but the point has been made and America can be used as a term for the Americas both.

https://www.coindesk.com/grayscale-drops-xrp-from-large-cap-crypto-fund-following-ripple-sec-suit
Stellar wont face a lawsuit from the SEC for a number of reasons one of which is they never sold XLM direct to consumers or customers. 
Another reason Circle seems to have gone through due diligence and have partnered with Stellar to run their USDC on XLM.
There's little chance they would do this if Stellar was facing any sort of legal trouble in the future.
I suspect Stellar is about to become the primary payments company / blockchain
USDC
Ukraine cbdc
German stablecoin
IBM / Worldwire

To make a long story short I think the sec‚Äôs involvement in this space has really just begun and I would expect a highly ramped up offensive by them upcoming. I think ‚Äúspeculators‚Äù are severely underestimating the power of the sec and the federal government. They can and will create an entire new sweeping legislation that could potentially classify crypto as an entirely new asset class. So to be fixated on whether or not something is a security is kind of short sighted and illuminating how little so many know about the regulatory bodies.
XLM was the only project that really spoke to me given my former background. I could really see the potential but not only that they actually were executing what they set out to do in real time. Not just an idea and hype. With that being said I expect the survivors, which probably includes XLM and Stellar to have to endure some very rough waters ahead and what that looks like on the other side might not be what people expect. Not trying to be a negative Nancy, just being very honest with my feelings given my prior experience. Your post was enticing.",1609861826,1609879826,1/5/2021 10:50,1

You skipped over an important part:
‚ÄúIn particular, the idea of decentralizing the transaction validation function in the network, which can be implemented most successfully by means of DLT, in fact contradicts the principle that only the NBU may issue e- hryvnia. The public accessibility of the Platform‚Äôs financial transactions for review and verification is not a crucial or, in certain cases, even desired feature of a technology used for CBDC.‚Äù
The report basically states that the public version of Stellar would‚Äôve possibly been ideal if they wanted their e-hryvnia to be decentralized, which they obviously don‚Äôt. They clearly saw clear-cut issues of not easily being able to follow updates on Stellar‚Äôs blockchain and had the foresight to understand a possible hostage situation if they were to work with a network managed by one private entity. The only way they would move forward with a DLT for their CBDC is if it‚Äôs ‚Äúdesigned on the basis of one of the public versions of modern powerful blockchain protocols‚Äù",1609857430,1609875430,1/5/2021 9:37,1

8486,8486,Marz_D,"You aren't fending off anything, you are creating FUD here. Stellar was **NEVER** deemed insufficient to be able to handle a CBDC by anyone. The problem is that Ukraine tested their ""e-hryvnia"". From page 30 of the pilot report:
"" Only ‚Äúclones‚Äù (copies with the modified configuration) of application software for the Platform‚Äôs nodes were used in the Pilot Project. This shows that the Platform‚Äôs resources are easy to scale in terms of technologies. However, using clones prevented the full assessment of effectiveness of the APIs suggested to external participants (developers) and the requirements for connection to the Platform. 
At the practical phase of the Pilot Project, the Platform was functioning continuously, including even technical emergencies that typically pertained to shutdowns or reboots of servers and communication equipment. It should be noted that the Platform required minimum monitoring and administrating by technical specialists responsible for operation of the Platform‚Äôs system and application resources. 
Performance assessment of the chosen technological solutions in ensuring main functions of the Platform allows making the following conclusion: **the chosen technology (DLT), architecture, and required administration functionality are adequate for implementing and supporting the core (the Platform‚Äôs main critical nodes at the NBU), given that the whole customer interaction functionality is transferred to the level of the agents‚Äô nodes**. Such functionality includes registration, network connection, customer software installation, as well as secure storage and administration of accounts with the secured secret keys. The Proof of Authority consensus is reached by two out of three validators approving a decision. "" 
 The problem is that using the private version of Stellar did not allow them to use all of the functionality and upgrades/fixes that later were implemented into the public version. From page 31: 
""The main technological risk for development and distribution of the Platform in its current version is that a private version of the Stellar blockchain protocol (which was brought in line with the NBU‚Äôs requirements) was used for the Platform. Such version hampers (virtually prevents) the elimination of errors and vulnerabilities of the Stellar blockchain protocol as well as the development of the Platform‚Äôs functions as new options are being added to the basic blockchain protocol.""

If his accusations were right - it's pretty obvious what would've happen till this point with the undervalued XLM :) The funny part is ... that even with these news - it's still undervalued. The ignorant people don't understand that this will spread the word for the crypto world more and more.,1609849261,1609867261,1/5/2021 7:21,1

8512,8512,sekzmasheen,"XLM Token Mechanics 101:  
TL:DR = XLM is currently removed from the market (demanded by users) by four main mechanisms, account creation, transaction fees, trustline creation and private payment channel reserves. It is a anti-inflationary coin and will be in very strong demand if the user-base continues to grow.  
Longer Version:  
1) Every user of Stellar Network (whether you're using the native token 'XLM' or some other token that was built on the network like 'USDC' (soon), 'SLT', 'MOBI', etc...) will need to have an 'account'. Each account requires a minimum balance of 'XLM' (currently 1XLM) to be operational. For non-technical users, it will be likely that they will have multiple accounts that have been opened up by issuers.  
2) For every token that is used by the account that is not the native token, that account needs to create a 'trustline' to enable transactions in that non-native token. To create a trustline, a 'trustline reserve' of 0.5XLM is currently required.  
3) The cost of the user to record a transaction or operation on the ledger is a MINIMUM of 0.0001XLM - this is called the 'base fee'. Where demand for transactions/operations increases beyond the current network limit of 1000 operations/ledger (about 6 seconds on average) the network will enter 'surge pricing mode' where operations and transactions that ""pay more"" fees than the 'base fee' will take priority in being recorded. These transaction fees are currently 'soft-burnt' into a 'fee pool account' that has no plans to ever be accessed.  
4) Private Payment Channels (still in the works) - Stellar is still working on project 'Starlight' which allows user to create private payment channels between users which requires a 'payment channel reserve' proportional to the largest transaction that the parties will make (e.g. if I wanted to setup a private payment network with a capacity of $1000USD then I would need to have a 'payment channel reserve' of $1000USD of XLM). The private transactions are fee-less, but they will lock away significant quantities of XLM.",1609849075,1609867075,1/5/2021 7:17,0

I have no doubts Stellar is in the best position to fulfill the use case. And the tech stack is ready!
Just let me correct you. 
Ripple cannot issue stablecoins yet, therefore is out of this game at the moment.  
USDC is also on the Algorand - moreover, which also supports the smart contracts already. So there are other networks than Stellar and Ripple. But to be honest, I do not quite understand their pure proof-of-stake. Basically, the most algos tokens one owns the higher chance is to be selected for the next consensus protocol round as the participant. They even explain it on the similarity of buying a lottery ticket.
And I do not believe any bank will ever participate in the network where they have to stake significant amount of the native tokens and moreover count with the probability some bad player wins the next Verifiable Random Function round and their results will be persisted into the blockchain.
As I mentioned I strongly believe Stellar is the best player on the field now. And with coming Smart contracts by end of 2021, I don't want to say it will hit the DeFi Ethereum projects hard, rather to say they will cooperate and it may offload the part of the job from them which Stellar will do better.",1609827436,1609845436,1/5/2021 1:17,1

1. Welcome to all the new community members that have been stopping by over the past few weeks. Please take a look at the subreddit rules when you have a moment. [https://reddit.com/r/stellar/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/stellar/wiki/rules)! Basically, don't attack people, try not to repost stuff already posted (same news from multiple sources), and please keep all speculation and price discussion in the Daily Chat thread. 
2. Obviously automod is busted for the daily. This is because reddit deprecated the old system and replaced it with something not as... dynamic? Anyways, the new daily chat thread should be up around 12am CST but it won't have the dates in the title anymore. F's in the chat all around. We'll see how it looks tomorrow and tweak it when the sub goes up in flames. (kidding of course)
3. I'd like to thank all of the community moderators and volunteers who have been helping out since this subreddit's inception.

8780,8780,ExactStart,"&gt; Metcalfe's law
I've been looking for something like that! Market cap has never made sense to me for cryptocurrencies. It's useful for evaluating a company since they have revenue streams, assets, and can be bought by other companies. You need to know the total value of a company. Nobody is ever going to acquire all of Bitcoin and it's current value doesn't mean everyone holding gets that amount. Market cap is maybe useful to indicate the health of a crypto, but I don't think it's useful for a commodity or a token with utility. A metric that includes things like traffic and accounts, maybe volume, would be so much more useful. imo crypto needs a better way of measuring value, but the issue is it would likely be different for different chains.",1609800914,1609818914,1/4/2021 17:55,1

You are forgetting that each account needs to hold a minimum amount of XLM + it needs to hold a certain amount of XLM for each trustline + all the other apps built on Stellar with all their users + the need for XLM liquidity to perform all the transactions and operations + people holding XLM.
XLM is undervalued. There are people/governments/corporations that would be able to theoretically buy all of them. I believe the price needs to be way higher so that the network is robust to such scenarios. Right now it's not that much of a threat because the Stellar ecosystem is in its infancy.

For an exchange of USD -&gt; EUR, a possible path payment could go over tokens of USD -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; CNY -&gt; XLM -&gt; EUR to minimize the rate of exchange.
These tokenized assets may then be withdrawn from the issuing vendor, kept or further exchanged on the Stellar network.
The Stellar token (XLM) acts as the payment intermediary and is also being used for fee payments.

8940,8940,Jtrades26,"Cryptocurrency fans in the United States will soon have their own debit card for holiday shopping.
Coinbase on Wednesday (Oct. 28) announced it is opening up a waitlist for U.S. consumers interested in applying for its new Coinbase Card, a Visa debit card that enables users to use their Bitcoin or other crypto holdings to shop online and in stores, in addition to converting their cryptocurrencies to cash at the ATM.
The good news is that the new Coinbase Card handles all the conversions itself, exchanging whatever cryptocurrency that users have in their accounts to U.S. dollars before completing purchases or ATM withdrawals, the company said.
The new Coinbase Card also features ‚Äúcrypto rewards‚Äù of as much as 4 percent back in Stellar Lumens (XLM) or 1 percent back in Bitcoin (BTC), with the rewards program initially limited to the U.S.
The pending arrival of the Coinbase Card in the U.S. market comes after a global push that has seen Coinbase launch the crypto card in just under 30 countries, including the United Kingdom and across Europe.
U.S. customers can apply for the new crypto debit cards through the Coinbase app or on its website, with the first customers to be approved over the winter, the company noted in a blog post.
A virtual card will be the first to arrive ‚Äî and can be used right away ‚Äî followed by a physical card in roughly two weeks.
The launch of the new Coinbase Cards comes amid growing signs that cryptocurrencies are moving more into the mainstream.
‚ÄúThe introduction of Coinbase Card was a significant milestone in our efforts to create mainstream adoption of crypto as a genuine utility,‚Äù Coinbase noted in a blog post announcing the pending U.S. launch of its crypto card. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement is another step forward in the real-world applications of cryptocurrency as it enables more options for Coinbase customers in the US to utilize their holdings. We will continue to build upon our offerings to create the most seamless and useful ways to manage crypto investing and spending for our customers.‚Äù",1609788557,1609806557,1/4/2021 14:29,0

8982,8982,sargsauce,"I think you're confusing the 0.5 XLM requirement with trustlines. A trustline means an account trusts the issuer of a particular token and can accept it into its account. (This way, you can be paid in the real USDC and not some knockoff USDP). So in order to set a trustline for USDC, my account needs to soft lock 0.5 XLM. Now I can transact with USDC as much as I want. And if someone has USDP and still needs to pay me, they can do a path payment USDP-&gt;XLM-&gt;USDC (which wallets can handle automatically in the background).
And further, if I want to use that same account to transact in BTC (issued by apay.io), then I can set a trustline to BTC (apay.io) and lock up another 0.5XLM (for a total of 1XLM for account + 0.5 for USDC + 0.5 for BTC). 
And every account that wants to do likewise has to do the same.
The tokens created on the network can be of arbitrary quantity from 1 to the data type's limit (which I think is like 900 billion and some).",1609786129,1609804129,1/4/2021 13:48,1

You can send/receive stable coins in seconds across borders without an intermediary as long as the liquidity is there and by the looks of the massive growth of dollars in usdc and others liquidity shouldnt be a problem. Though im not in banking or finance so maybe im missing something?
Must be a reason the likes of Circles usdc has chosen stellar too.

u/sargsace posted this yesterday in the daily chat...copy pasting here:
""More accounts and more transactions, which increases demand and reduces supply.
Each account needs 1 XLM to open plus 0.5 per token (e.g. 0.5 for USDC, 0.5 for BTC token, 0.5 for ETH token, etc). 
Each account burns 0.00001 XLM per transaction. For like-kind transactions (USDC-&gt;USDC) that's 1 transaction. For a conversion (USDC-&gt;XLM-&gt;EURO), that's 2 transactions.
Stellar could be the preferred network due to its speed, lower (edit: and predictable) operating cost, built in KYC/AML features, simpler architecture (i.e. simpler to secure), and features like fee bumps and SEP-30 key management that takes user confusion out of the equation (see meme posts recently in ethereum subreddit about the guy who gets two transactions stuck in limbo because he didn't calculate enough gas properly...or cries for help because they sent $50k LINK to to a smart contract that doesn't accept it and now it's possibly gone forever).""",1609780035,1609798035,1/4/2021 12:07,0

9307,9307,samlapoint,"I believe it can hit well over a dollar within a year and this is why.   
\-  The emerging regulatory clarity and enforcement will eliminate a lot of the bad cryptocurrencies that are currently taking market share from the stronger assets, like XLM. 
\- Those that withstand the regulatory crackdown will see the majority of institutional money flow and we haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg in that regard.   
\- The big institutional players coming in will follow suite with the early crypto investment groups like DCG, many of which have a stake in XLM. Don't be surprised when you hear X or Y investment group has expanded their position from Bitcoin and Ethereum to include XLM.   
\- Stellar is likely to occupy the space that Ripple had. It's really just a matter of time and a few good announcements. The ""XRP army"" will realize there won't be a miraculous comeback and many of them will shift toward XLM. 
\- If you subscribed to the S2F model or anything akin to it, this is really only the beginning of the bull market and XLM ( looking at the logarithmic chart ) has truly stabilized at these ranges, so it's going to have a much easier time blowing through its past ATH.
\- The market repeatedly exceeds expectations. People thought Tim Draper was crazy when he predicted Bitcoin at 10K but it went TWICE as high. Likewise, I remember when people said there's no way XLM or XRP could ever hit the $1-3 range but that's exactly what happened.   
\- The networking effect that created the 2017 frenzy will likely be twice if not three times bigger this time. Unlike 2017, it won't just be a bunch of college kids, retail investors and crypto enthusiasts. This bull market, we're going to see the normalization of crypto investing across the board.

Follow up, if I may: if XLM is only sold to fund operations, what incentive is their for the bag holders to continue holding? In other words, if there is no eventual utility that will drive up the price of XLM (as was the claim with XRP) and if the sole purpose of XLM is to give capital to Stellar, why would one hold onto XLM?

Also to be objective there are other blockchains that offer more privacy. Others are just as decentralized if not more. Nano is just as fast and free no fees I believe. Ethereum has smart contracts that have more robustness.
All that not withstanding I have personally poured over whitepapers, subs, boards, discords, telegrams, fb pages and more meetups then I care to mention.
Stellar just is simply the most complete blockchain, and it‚Äôs getting better.

To answer your Q:
Ripple (Private Company) sold XRP and talked about price, their lawyers even warned them about it.
Stellar Development Foundation (Non Profit) also sells XLM but only to fund their operations and no one profits from the price action except the Foundation to further their mission and obviously all the speculators here.

9351,9351,potato_teko,"Thanks I didn‚Äôt know ‚ÄúUSDC-&gt;XLM-&gt;EURO‚Äù counts as 2 transactions, Nice!
and just a quick note to correct one point about the transaction fees:
According to [SDF BLOG](https://www.stellar.org/blog/sdfs-next-steps): ‚ÄúWe have since decided to include the Fee Pool in the total supply because network validators could theoretically vote for a protocol change that would affect the fee pool. The fee pool is where network fees collect. The lumens do not belong to any particular account. No one has access to fee pool, so these lumens are non-circulating. So there are slightly more than 50B lumens in existence.‚Äù
So, transaction fess are NOT burnt which means these are NOT reduced from the total supply. 
However, right, just because it is not burnt, still those transaction fees are sent to an inaccessible account on the Stellar network, in other words, it still contributes to the reduction of the supply of available XLM, which means, we can still say that it contributes the value of XLM, however the transaction fee of Stellar is so low enough, it won't really affect the value of XLM noticeably UNLESS the Stellar network is used by, literally, people all over the world with decent amount of transactions everyday. 0.00001 per operation, if a person did 1000 transactions today, it costs only 0.01 XLM, if 1 million people in our city did 1000 transactions today, the total transaction costs for it would only be 10,000 XLM (roughly over 1350 USD at the current rate), and we have the total supply of 50,001,803,567.8717164 XLM. Therefore, this is in my opinion, we can not really expect the value of XLM rises by amount of transactions.
P.S. I'm still new to this Stellar community, so if I misunderstand transaction fees, please someone help me understand the correlation between the value of XLM and transaction volume.",1609718549,1609736549,1/3/2021 19:02,0

9450,9450,beans_lel,"&gt; but cant they make it require the memo field before sending? Seems like it would save a lot of trouble.
They actually can! Since early last year, Stellar accounts have an optional `memo_required` field. If your wallet client is updated to the latest Stellar SDK, it will not allow you to make a transfer without a memo to an address that has set the `memo_required` field. 
But this was only a temporary solution and still allows for user error with the memo field. The real solution was introduced in Stellar protocol version 13: [https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md](First-class multiplexed accounts). It allows exchanges to add the memo field directly to the address. So they can give each user a unique address and they all point to the same wallet with the memo field already included. Bam, user only needs to copy-paste one address just like other cryptos and that's it. No more faulty/missing memo fields.
So this is entirely on Coinbase for not keeping up with the latest developments, Stellar protocol 13 has been live for half a year now. 
By the way, there is a very good reason why the memo field works the way it does. It's because Stellar is focused on banking and remittance, and they share some of the same design elements. The memo field is Stellar's version of the wire transfer message field. Just like with a regular wire transfer, it's optional and you can still send money without it, but if you send it to a pooled account the receiver will need to manually verify who sent the money.",1609687219,1609705219,1/3/2021 10:20,1

9461,9461,TRossW18,"The most defining feature of all the networks is their consensus mechanism. I.e., how the blockchain verifies transactions. There are 3 main mechanisms: PoW, PoS, and BFT.
ADA reaches consensus through Proof of Stake (PoS). Stellar uses its own BFT consensus called Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). These are not trivial differences at all.
For PoS to reach consensus a significant amount of the coins on the network need to be ""staked"". The stakers act as validators; without enough of them the network is not secure. To ensure security, these networks offer rewards (interest essentially) on staked assets. However, this may run into some long-term economic issues. 
In order to convince people to lock up their tokens for staking, the rewards to stake would have to be greater than any of the rewards not to stake. Considering the current craze of defi lending this puts the network in direct competition with the products on the network. I.e, for the network to be secure, rewards must be higher than the rewards to not stake, but for applications on the network to be viable they must offer rewards greater than the reward to stake--or else everyone would just stake.",1609683911,1609701911,1/3/2021 9:25,0

- What price do you expect that xlm can achieve during 2021? And why? I don‚Äôt have a solid prediction neither a reason to shoot a value, so I‚Äôd like to know your opinion.
- Decoupling from XRP may be harder than you think, but that is definitely the way to go, as it presents some advantages: 1) money inflow to xlm from xrp; 2) clear difference between the 2 projects (leading xlm to be the top coin)

9633,9633,onthesunnysideofthe,"You're best off reading through the 10-20 last daily comment threads on this sub, where the question you ask has been asked close to 100 times over the last month. There's no foundational correlation beyond psychological correlations between the two projects, which are not grounded in reason or any technical motivation. 
This is not a huge deal beyond the short term, as more people realize this each day. Additionally, coinbase is delisting XRP (a major event) which will just leave XLM. XLM is soon to host USDC on its chain, something I've yet to update myself on the technical facts that might be relevant to how this will impact XLM usage, price, adoption, etc. But I gather this is quite noteworthy, considering that both XLM and USDC are in the top 10 cryptos for market cap. 
In short, that a loose correlation between the price of these two assets - one of which is essentially dead for the time being due to the SEC lawsuit, should not really impact your choices surrounding holding or dumping XLM. That is, unless you *need* whatever fiat is held up in your XLM at this time - but if that's the case, then you'd be breaking rule number one of investing which is: ""don't invest what you can't afford to lose."" When you stick to this rule, you lose a lot less sleep over any underwater longs you currently have. That is not to say that you shouldn't strive to get to the bottom of your ""confusion"" as you put it - you most definitely should. But posting in the daily with a question that's been parroted so much recently isn't likely to yield you a thorough and informative response such as the one I've attempted to comment here - which is why I made my initial suggestion to take the time to read through old daily threads, use the wonderful resource that is the internet to educate yourself on the technical differences between XLM and XRP, and then act accordingly",1609625139,1609643139,1/2/2021 17:05,0

9896,9896,mcpickems,"I suppose i was not clear enough with my distinction and I apologize. Stellar does indeed have a different way of going about it. And Ripple‚Äôs solution is different and Stellars could save money where Ripple‚Äôs can‚Äôt. That i will admit i had wrong. 
However, the stellar system usage, in aggregate leads to XLM volume. The current daily volume of 500m is not of any significance which indicates stellars unique systems are not being used yet in a commercial sense given the fact cross border payments are trillions daily being processed by SWIFT.
However, even Stellars unique system has to beat Ripple‚Äôs and also legacy systems. I personally can‚Äôt conceive a scenario on which Stellar‚Äôs systems are fully capable of capturing value but are purposely ‚Äúturned off‚Äù if you will. Maybe because i‚Äôm not a developer I suppose. 
I just don‚Äôt understand what is taking so long. I‚Äôve been following crypto since 2017 and Stellar not so much. I don‚Äôt own any but after tonight am actually leaning towards it. I did own XRP a year ago but sold it for different things which I am satisfied with.
I just don‚Äôt get how there‚Äôs 500M volume and supposedly many companies making things. I came searching for answers as to when the volume might pickup when international payments begin to be absorbed by stellar.

How you build your ledger and how build a company and attack a problem is not semantics.
The person that you keep saying helped just pointed you to Cowrie, Lightnet and Velo, as I did hours ago. 
Stellar is building a network that is facilitating crypto companies to be built from the ground up. The major feature is utilizing multi-country stablecoins as entry/exit points. That is what they a centrally focused on and that's how cross border payments makes sense. From there they have been focused on building tools that allow 3rd parties to build complete blockchain companies atop their network. 
Ripple said they don't agree with stablecoins and rather than focusing building out a suite of developer tools centered around 3rd parties building on top of the ledger they tried to create fragmented solutions and sell them off to existing companies. Those companies were not built to be integrated with blockchain protocols. The protocol isn't being built out to foster network effects. And they're not focusing on the key element of having stablecoins to settle in different countries. They're model makes no sense. 
Lightnet and Velo are massive ventures with massive backing being built from day one to be a blockchain company first. They're not being pitched by Stellar to pivot from an already profitable venture. 
Stellar has perhaps the most real world adoption underway. If their natworks becomes a big player with new generation companies running on it (which is already starting) XLM will be just fine.

9905,9905,mcpickems,You can list hundreds of companies that are building on the stellar network. But as you must agree demand and volume is not being driven to the XLM token yet from these businesses in any major fashion yet because of the current price of XLM.,1609478939,1609496939,1/1/2021 0:28,0
9907,9907,mcpickems,"I compare the two because they are very similar and many regards. XRP and XLM both have extremely similar properties in terms of speed and ledger fees and products whether made by 3rd parties or stellar or Ripple are going to be structurally similar as they will all utilize XLM or XRP in some fashion. These blockchain solutions must be more efficient than blockchain solutions. 
What do you think the 3rd parties are building? Obviously something that uses XLM as a basis for conducting the transaction and by extension the stellar blockchain. As i said, Ripple is doing the same thing themselves using the XRP blockchain to create a solution with XRP in the center, thus why i say you are arguing semantics. 
You really didn‚Äôt explain why it doesn‚Äôt make sense for Transferwise to use Ripple‚Äôs solution but Stellar‚Äôs could work  because you didn‚Äôt make any real point as to how they‚Äôre different. Ripple makes a network product through the existence of the XRP ledger Stellar makes the XLM ledger and i suppose these 3rd parties are making the network products. Great. I was searching for evidence of real world usage of Stellar network. Another user answered my question well enough 
Clearly, demand for the XLM token is not significant in a business utility sense due to the price being well below ATH prices that was driven solely by speculation. I believe financial companies using the network for payments will bring demand to XLM and the price will go up.  The amount of demand for international payments greatly exceeds potential speculative demand so therefor when major adoption begins the price can greatly go past ATH.
My point was that clearly this is not here. Everyone says businesses are coming. Great.  I wanted to see evidence of usage and business integrations. As ive said, the lack of demand indicates there is not major business use. 
If Ripple and XRP  can‚Äôt save money for companies when in general it is more liquid than XLM in virtually all markets it is worrying. But as i said, another user helped. Thanks",1609478682,1609496682,1/1/2021 0:24,1

I only ask this additional question because after reading the testimony of a company saying Ripple‚Äôs solution can‚Äôt save them money without subsidies it makes me worry about blockchain solutions in general as the company is a payment provider that sends low value high frequency payments which are a perfect start for blockchain solutions.

10047,10047,dewdropdead,"Obviously just my view, but I think it's good sense to never rule out market manipulation. I remember reading about the bitwise analysis of trades that concluded 
&gt;Approximately 95% of reported BTC trading volume is fake
&amp;nbsp;
It's not difficult for exchanges or big holders to steer the market, just as MM's do with regular stocks. It's in their interests to make money however they can, especially in a space thats only in the infancy of regulation.
&amp;nbsp;
If I try to look at XLM objectively, I don't see a significant incentive for Stellar to drive the price of XLM in either direction as they are focussed on utility based objectives that will work regardless.
If I look at XRP however, and was in Ripples position, I can see reasonable incentive there to do my best to limit the degridation of value, especially in light of such negative news. Obviously I'm just speculating here, but would you seriously go long on XRP before you had a real indication of how things were going to develop with the Ripple case?
&amp;nbsp;
In anycase, bitcoin is the current winner vs these two, so it's logical to assume people will currently be trading to BTC, and if you compare BTC to both XLM and XRP it's obvious XRP has suffered worse in terms of percentage loss. Once BTC tops out I expect we'll see some shift back towards the alt's, whether that is reflected in overall USD value is the question though.",1609420698,1609438698,12/31/2020 8:18,1

During the past week I completely lost my faith in the sanity of the crypto world. We have a blockchain/network which is the leader in terms of usage (transactions) and it got pushed down by a currency which obviously had just paid partners to announce stuff. Stellar has so many (real) connections to big tech player. They talk to and with regulators on a regular basis. And again, they have the most used blockchain/network. During 2017 the daily transactions were between 5000-25000. In the past week Stellar had 25.000.000 transactions.

My advice, as a long-time XLM hodler, is for Stellar to focus and not be a jack of all trades, master of none. If people want to pursue projects built off or using the XLM blockchain that's fine, but they shouldn't expect it to cater to them insofar as the optimizations they require conflict with its core purpose.",1609372237,1609390237,12/30/2020 18:50,1

The Stellar Development Foundation is a non-profit and the price point of their native token actually has little bearing on the success of the project overall. All that said, I am holding XLM because I find the arguments compelling regarding widespread adoption and eventual price gains. Stellar is well on its way to fulfilling the mission of being the global payment standard. It's working well and closely with governments, international finance orgs, etc. It has the right tech, the right approach to regulation, and most importantly (to me) an ethical commitment to providing low-cost and easy access to financial services with an open-source, decentralized solution. 
It's looking like a slow burn, but as adoption increases so will price and those who decided to speculate on XLM are going to be happy they did so, IMHO.",1609360697,1609378697,12/30/2020 15:38,1

Two final questions--have you tried deleting the stellar wallet from your ledger and reinstalling it?  Regardless of the first question, are you able to access your wallet using the ledger on the [stellar account viewer](https://accountviewer.stellar.org/#!/)?  I just ask because if you are able to connect to the blockchain and look at your funds(which I think you said you could since it works with stellarX?), then we can safely say that the issue is likely due to the ledger live app.  An old stellar wallet app will still connect to the blockchain on stellar X or the account viewer, but it might have problems playing nicely with ledger live.

It seems like maybe the program is trying to free memory it hasn't allocated or is trying to allocate memory for a structure that isn't of the correct type.  
I would try to completely uninstall ledger live, check for any windows updates, install them, and then reinstall ledger live.  There is a chance that your ledger live installation has become corrupt or that every time you install it, it is corrupted by the OS due to some broken OS files or c++ libraries. 
If you cannot get it to work by simply reinstalling ledger live, perhaps try it on a different PC, or you could try installing linux in a duel boot situation and try running ledger live from there.  If none of that is possible or convenient, you could always reinstall/repair Windows which should fix any issues with your c++ libraries.",1609352441,1609370441,12/30/2020 13:20,1

10285,10285,sargsauce,"**And now for something completely different**
&amp;#x200B;
Stellar is a prize fighter,
a phoenix that'll rise brighter,
sentiment culls herds tighter
with each cycle, feelin bags lighter.
Load it up and then ignite her.
Moon's incoming--knuckles whiter.
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
But hold on, take a sec,
man the typewriter,
to record the story
of this great uniter.
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
Stellar was a seed, a germ of a thought,
a way for value to be freed of the tangled knot of fiat
fraught with a lot of inefficiencies and ingrained deficiencies
a drain on self-sufficiency--
a real life drag coefficient, see,
cos when real people are in need--
traditional banks could make a stone bleed.
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
What standard payments lacked in speed
they made up in spades with greed
with enough overhead to impede
people's wealth accumulation.
In Monopoly, the only option's capitulation--
to entrust your value and security
to an archaic system's stunted maturity.
We can translate Spanish to German
using algorithms to determine
how to get from Point A to Point B.
So trading pesos to euros
should be a matter of ratios
but orthodox systems add in Point C.
C wants a cut, a larger slice of the pie
For so long, we never stopped to ask why
A sent a remittance and B gets a mere pittance
And C, slow as a snail, grew too big to fail.
But never mind that, don't look past the veil
Don't see how it's propped up so frail.
Outdated inventions blown up to scale
Requiring human intervention
Not to mention innumerable risks from
Blindly trusting vulnerable systems
But with profits so sweet, who can resist 'em?
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
But if we had a universal language
A public ledger with a built-in bridge
That could represent endless tokens
Anchor it down so the seam's unbroken.
Then users could have true custody,
With an open source network that's trusted-- we
wouldn't believe that such a rusted heap
was the global standard for generations.
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
Enter the Stellar Development Foundation
With just the thing to better unite our nations
Drive international and regulatory relations,
Built-in KYC, AML applications.
Efficiency, user friendly, SEP-30
Each of these among their innovations
Streamlined to end blockchain frustrations
""Bank the unbanked"" is their open invitation.
All people can have financial stability,
To see and partake in the possibilities
Of futuristic economic mobility.
SDF's got the skills to be
the biggest thing of this century
with a track record of successfully
improving and growing aggressively
to ensure the network's used extensively.
Near or far, measure the distance and see
That path payments hop virtually free

Both platforms share a founder, the protocols works in a similar fashion, both had two entities using their respective token (XLM,XRP) to grow the platform....etc. You don't think that in the early/foundational years of Stellar that McCaleb didn't use XLM to fund the project?? The SEC is going to look at XLM and say ""if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck!"" Also, those who like to offer the argument that the SDF is a non-profit so that gives XLM a free pass are living in an alternate universe. They are like Alice-In-Wonderland falling down that rabbit hole of delusion and deceit. The SDF, in many ways, have used their XLM holdings in the very same manner as Ripple to build out the Stellar ecosystem. Think about this for a second. It's been almost 4 years since the SEC came out and said that Ether and Btc were not securities....4 YEARS!!!! The only other two projects that they've offered an opinion on were EOS and KIN after they sued and settled with them. If the SEC felt so strongly that XLM was not a security don't you think they would've said it by now? The SEC would've given XLM the same designation as Ether and Bitcoin if they felt as if it met their test of decentralization etc. The folks at the SEC are not stupid despite what ppl may believe. I believe that EOS and KIN were the trial runs for the SEC and they are 2-0 right now. It's no surprise that they've gone after Ripple. They like high-profile cases and adversaries with lots of $$$!!

Price wise it‚Äôs very hard to say as with all crypto related stuff. Stellar avoids pushing xlm as an investment, something I think many holders have been frustrated with in the past, but are likely very happy about now.

What I've learnt over the years is that it's almost impossible to predict a ""probable"" price for a coin. Crypto is the wild, wild west. What I will say is that XLM peaked at around $0.90 back in the 2017/2018 mega alt bull run. If it reaches this level again you're looking at a 6X+ on your current investment (assuming you got in around 15 cents). Now last time BTC peaked at just under 20k; this time BTC is likely heading to the 50-100k range, if not higher. Now consider how much more institutional and retail money is interested in crypto now compared to 3 years ago. If that money starts flowing into alts (which inevitably it will during a BTC bull run), XLM hitting XRP's peak prices back in 2018 (around $3.80) doesn't seem so unreasonable now does it?",1609242499,1609260499,12/29/2020 6:48,0

-XRP is not being as widely adopted as the company had painted
-The top execs at Ripple have done some really shady things for personal gains and misrepresented A LOT of information to XRP investors
-It seemed like Ripple was more in the industry of offering XRP at a discount than offering a legit remittance service that provided value.

* Founders got a lot of the initial tokens
* Ripple keeps pumping the price in the public while selling behind the scenes
* Ripple creating 'paid' partnerships, without forcing escrowed funds on those partners. Thus allowing partners to immediately dump on the market.
* Ripple avoids visibility into the above practices.
Compare to SDF:
* No ICO, but has a large printed supply in escrow to fund their organization.
* Spending funds to developing the network utilization projects/enhance the network. Everything developed leads to token utilization on the network/requires token to utilize.
* Lack of large scale payouts to the founders
* SDF does not talk about price and price of token doesn't matter to them. People get angry that they don't talk about price/pump it but it's for a very good reason.
* SDF provides monetary grants to secure utilization/future network development, but typically in escrowed accounts.
* SDF provides full accounting visibility to their respective wallets.
TL;DR: SDF has the large printed supply in escrow being used to fund their organization which is a potential vulnerability for regulation, but the XRP lawsuit is a very specific targetted lawsuit towards ripple due to a pattern of sketchy behavior. The main difference i'd highlight is using proceeds from the token to develop solutions that don't require the token, and then making profits from selling those solutions. There is also an aspect that ripple knowingly did the above practices for years after knowing about the potential SEC oriented ramifications.",1609203585,1609221585,12/28/2020 19:59,0

I will maybe wait for the 10 cents (euro) to buy xlm again, i sold a couple of days ago when news about xrp broke out.
I will try to buy 50k XLM at that value and then hold them during 2021, unless we somehow see a huge bull market, which will make me sell them.
That being said, I believe that anything below 12/13 cents ($) is a good entry point, as a lot of good things are happening with stellar at the moment.

They were not both created by stellar.
Ripple created XRP and Stellar created XLM. Jed actually was part of Ripple and he left in clash with the board to create Stellar.
They are similar in their nature, but they are different companies and stellar is much more well protected against SEC lawsuits (non profit, it‚Äôs been part of a lot of talks with the IMF, WEF, among others, and is not involved in shady stuff like distributing tokens for free with no context whatsoever).

10848,10848,sargsauce,"Not OP, but I think there are a few different dynamics in play.
1) To mine, a miner must perform calculations (expending energy).
2) The difficulty of those calculations depends on how many miners are working at a given time
3) The energy spent mining has a real world, up front cost. Miners are motivated to *not* sell at a loss, therefore it creates a sort of logical price floor.
4) increased chain usage does not directly affect difficulty (as far as I know), however there is a human factor where increased usage drives demand and affects price and could serve as an incentive for more miners to join to try to get a slice of the pie. (Note: price can of course increase without increased usage and you'd get the same effect)
5) more miners increases the difficulty, which increases energy usage.

The Fee Pool is where network fees collect. The lumens do not belong to any particular account. No one has access to fee pool, so these lumens are non-circulating. Network validators could theoretically vote for a protocol change that would affect the fee pool, so we include it in the total supply. Stellar‚Äôs transaction fees are extremely low‚Äì1/100,000th of a lumen per operation‚Äìso the fee pool grows very slowly.

From my underlying understanding of the tech, the ""difficulty"" of mining 1 btc is integral to the value of the coin itself due to the actual CPU work input / output needed to generate a coin which I suppose instills it with an inherent value derived from the monetary value of computing power / energy. 
I wonder if there's a way to synthesize the difficulty while still preserving the ""competitive"" elements of the mining process. I'm sure my layman understanding is flawed and over simplified, and am fairly confident that any attempts to alter the process of mining in anyway to be more ecofriendly would very likely corrupt BTC from the core.

In regards to the SDF, it is a nonprofit foundation. The defintion of a security is loose, especially in crypto, but it still has to make sense. A security is typically two things: 1) An equity stake or 2) A loan (bonds). The current SEC suit against Ripple is clearly in regards to type 1--no one is claiming XRP is an implied loan.
An equity stake is an expected claim on some portion of profits. It a quote uncommon for a nonprofit organization to have shareholders because they are legally prohibited from earning profits. 
For XLM to be considered a security it would have to be a security of something. Would it be a security of a nonprofit foundation? That just wouldn't make any logical sense.

Can anyone take away my fears for Jed or the SDF being sued by the SEC? 
When you see how the market reacts to SEC suing Ripple, I think I'm not alone in considering the option that the SEC will be eying SDF/Jed next.
Ive been here since nov 2017. I believed in SDF, Jed and xlm ever since. I still do. Because everything I hear about SDF or about Jed is that they are trying to be compliant. But when the SEC will start suing Jed, I do think it will be a major blow to SDF as a whole.

**53. The Legal Memos warned that there was some risk that XRP would be considered an ‚Äúinvestment contract‚Äù (and thus a security) under the federal securities laws depending on various factors. These included, among other things, how Ripple promoted and marketed XRP to potential purchasers, the motivation of such purchasers, and Ripple‚Äôs other activities with respect to XRP. If individuals purchased XRP ‚Äúto engage in speculative investment trading‚Äù or if Ripple employees promoted XRP as potentially increasing in price, the Legal Memos warned that Ripple would face an increased risk that XRP units would be considered investment contracts (and thus securities).**",1608990534,1609008534,12/26/2020 8:48,1

It did revive the interest in the project but surely it could have been done without it). 
Also no coin burns that are intended to boost the price are probably problematic, except when you have an ICO in USA and are actively promoting your token's price increase as the reason why investors should buy the token in the first place.

And Stellar has been aware of all the actions of Ripple that regulators found sketchy at best. Another reason why PRICE is a topic nobody at SDF has ever discussed. Any talk other than ""that's up to the public"" is forbidden for them. We've all noticed this over the years. 
Stellar doesn't and didn't operate their business like Ripple did. Nobody can find any of the things SEC is accusing Ripple being applicable to Stellar. If they could, surely they would go after them first since they are an easier target and potentially eliminating them would cause far less damage to people outside Stellar. 
Just pulling out a statement because the technology forked 7 years ago doesn't cause them to be in danger.
The reason why Ripple is in danger are their business practices, not XRP or their tech.
Starting with the fact they had an ICO to raise funds. Remember how everyone who had ICOs were registered outside of USA for this exact reason?
Stellar had no ICO.
Stellar is registered as a non profit in a state where as long as their income isn't used for profit(this EXCLUDES operating costs) they don't even have to pay taxes. 
Even if they lose their status they'll just have to pay taxes on profit, which to this day, there is NONE.
You know how Ripple failed to be approved by regulators in New York and Stellar was approved? These are the differences that have been leading up to this lawsuit for two years now.
It's not even a coincidence why Ripple started looking for a way out of USA this year. They picked UK as their potential heaven because they left EU(an even more regulated place than USA). None of these things are coincidences. Ripple knew this was coming and those 3 guys just filled their pockets so they could survive any potential long trials and recovery time required if and when they win the case.
Hopefully they come out as winners. Not because I give a fsck about Ripple(just their posts on forums and attitude of those 3 CEOs is appalling) but because it would be positive news for crypto in general.

11214,11214,StableRare,"IMO, the SDF needs to be proactive and get ahead of any SEC scrutiny.   I think if the SDF takes a wait-and-see approach to the SEC enforcement, that will be a huge mistake. If they win over Ripple (either via lawsuit or a significant settlement), SDF the next obvious target. The biggest issue SDF has is the centralization concern by owning the majority of XLM tokens. They need to reduce this quickly without selling them for profit (which would only make things worse). They need to either burn or airdrop (in 1:1 ratio to current non-SDF wallets) enough XLM so they are much lower than majority control. Ideally, they should get it below 25%. Otherwise, it will cost them a lot more in SEC action and investors in XLM in price depreciation. Thoughts?",1608954956,1608972956,12/25/2020 22:55,1

11292,11292,romangiler,"Purely my opinion of course, not giving out advice.
I like AnchorUSD and Nexo. 
AnchorUSD:
Pros: 
Easy to buy crypto! Bye bye CB üëé I like this A LOT!
High Yield Interest Accounts (i.e. USDC 7-8% APY - CB 0.15% APY) better than any bank unless you live in Ukraine(sorry) or somewhere else where Inflation is just as high. 
Native Stellar wallet, NO MEMO üôè 
Interest on all crypto (varied APY%)
Can withdraw small amounts. 
Margin Trading!
Cons: 
Hard to get Customer Service to respond.
Baked in Spread 1.5% calculated by others on this sub (Nothing is free, despite their claims)
Pricing is unclear, basically a Double Whammy, weird strike price which is aggressively in their favor and a spread on top of that price. 
Nexo: 
Pros:
Higher Interest than AnchorUSD (XLM 5% vs 2.78%)
Even Higher Interest than point #1 so AnchorUSD is far behind in some respects. If you choose their NEXO token (I didn‚Äôt)
Get Cash! Nexo lends against your crypto (Not a taxable event and you keep your crypto)
Security: On point, very strong security.
Cons: 
Cannot buy/trade through Nexo you either save and earn or lend against your assets.
Debit Card... unless you travel around the world why?",1608913119,1608931119,12/25/2020 11:18,0

11398,11398,Oneltz,"At least on the Reddit threads, I‚Äôve noticed a difference in the tone and perspectives of the XRP community and the XLM community. Some hold both, which I did until two days ago. I looked more deeply into the origins of the companies and the missions of both. I think that the mission of XLM seems to reflect the dispositions of those who HODL it. Likewise, some, not all, seem to reflect a different disposition that feels more consistent with the attitudes of the principal owners.  Am I off here? With Jed‚Äôs vision for the unbanked and underbanked, providing a way for everyone to have, hold, and exchange income, has that humanitarian aspect of the general cryptoverse. Hoskinson said he didn‚Äôt feel the same unifying vibe from Brad and Chris that has brought the origins of cryptocurrency into existence- make the world better. At least that is what I am taking from my further reading and gleaning. I am new to this space, and I am glad I have found it. Yes, I sold my bags of XRP when the bad news hit. Some would say I bailed and only the strong hands will survive. But I have no regrets. The Lumenauts have a disposition that is more in line with my own. I agree that we welcome the new XRP community into the Stellar community with open arms.

Smartlands team has done a wonderful job building a platform to issue digital backed assets. They even did a pilot in the UK and was the first blockchain company to have FCA approved. The pilot went well however they called off the ABT token distribution because of a  rift with the partner, However they gave a full year of interest on your investment @ 12 per annum.
Smatlands realized retail is not ready for ABT's and the way forward is institutional investors. They got the cold shoulder from SDF as well. Long story short, They decided to build on Cosmos and launch mainnet in 2021.
However, something changed in mid-2020 and they got backing from SDF to stay on stellar.
Thankyou SDF and Smartlands for sorting things out. I would have hated smart lands to go away from this huge use case.
Fast forward, Smartlands working agroxy for agriculture commodity exchange. This is itself very huge, for the folks who understand how big a use case this is and can be replicated across the world.
Plus working on ABT tokens for institutional and real estate market.

With this monthly auto reserve purchase plan, you can set from a minimum of 1000 JPY to a maximum of 50,000 JPY. So, you can think, super roughly, $10 to $500 range in USD.

Look at the macro. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/MEuIWDzO/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/MEuIWDzO/)
This pullback represented a 78.6% retracement of the prior move up. The fact that buyers stepped in and defended that support level is bullish, especially if we can get some closes at higher timeframes (1 day or 1 week candles) above it. If you look closely (I'm using 3 day candles), you can also see that this pullback returns to a prior resistance (now support) level we tested in August, then broke through in November. From a technical analysis (TA) point of view, we've got some confluence between 2 major support levels and other indicators like RSI suggesting XLM is oversold on intraday (4hr) timeframes.
People will condemn applying TA to alts, but from a TA perspective, it reads like a buy. I say this as someone who has analyzed XLMUSD and XLMBTC pairs for 3 years. I've been wrong before and I'll be wrong again. These are just my thoughts since you asked.",1608790336,1608808336,12/24/2020 1:12,0

This is a power play by some very large financial firms who stand to lose a lot in cross-border payments if crypto-assets like XLM and XRP ever get the green light. They used an SEC chief on the way out the door to do their bidding. Do you not ever wonder why XLM and XRP have yet to receive clarity from the SEC but yet BTC and ETH have all the clarity in the world allowing companies to build on top of their platforms without fear of retaliation from regulators? It's because the rich own BTC and ETH and your large correspondent bank are scared of losing their monopoly and cash cow around cross-border payments etc.  They fear XLM and XRP. The vast majority of your up and coming economies cannot stand having to go through SWIFT + Corresponded banks and having to pay the exuberant fees. Using Stellar and Ripple DLT/Blockchain platforms they can create their own payments network and get from under the JP Morgan's, Citi's, and HBSC's of the world. 
Think about who really owns the bulk of BTC and ETH. Every day you hear of some multibillion-dollar corporation, hedge fund, etc making multi-million dollar purchases of BTC and ETH.  The powers that be want their share of XLM and XRP. They want in on some of that +50 billion XRP that are in Ripple's XRPL Escrow accounts and Ripple said HELL NO and made them buy it OTC or from exchanges. Ripple understands the value of their XRP holdings and how they are using them to create a PaaS ecosystem. 
The problem here is that the XLM and XRP communities are so hell-bent on going after each other's throats that we are not focused on the culprits behind the lack of clarity for 99% of digital assets/crypto. If you go down the former SEC Chairman's Alice-In-Wonderland [**rabbit hole**](https://twitter.com/Santiag78758327/status/1341857200193622020) you will find some very interesting things.",1608783507,1608801507,12/23/2020 23:18,0

If anything the XRP lawsuit doesnt name Jed personally, just as ""Co-Founder"" (undeniably Jed McCaleb based on the profile provided in the suit and the facts) but does not mention him past the paragraph describing when Ripple was informed by attorneys that XRP ""may"" be seen as a security on October 19, 2012. As I recall, Jed left Ripple shortly thereafter. 
While he's not personally named, I feel like the way they laid it out makes it safe to infer that Jed himself likely disagreed with the other co-founders of Ripple when it came to the strategy for distribution, which could at least partially explain why he left in 2013 and almost certainly explains why SDF is set up as a non-profit.",1608768371,1608786371,12/23/2020 19:06,0

Keep thinking sellers are exhausted here and can't help but think this dump is misaligned with reality / usecase, etc.
Not one for FUD but do feel kind of silly being scared of taxes and not taking profits closer to .19 after a basically 2x + rise in such a short time. Had plans to take some into BTC or USD if we moved further up into solid mid .20's
Not going to add to the slew of other comments expressing FUD, disappointment, and unrealized losses, b/c that's not my prerogative
Won't try to predict the future but would be pleased, and not totally surprised if we saw some sort of bounce soon. If this wen't under .10 I'd transfer more fiat.
What was stupid was throwing some additional chunks of fiat in around .17 despite my very low average cost, feeling that XLM was in fact undervalued within the context of coinbase XLM cash back, likely paypal support, and its general utility, usec ase, and legitimate partnerships.
**In short, if you're new to crypto / alt coins and hopped on XLM recently for one reason or another (be it a well-informed choice or attempting to make quick gains on ""XRP"" #2 - which XLM couldn't be further from actually being - I'd recommend sitting on your hands for a few days instead of selling at a loss and getting potentially left in the dust.**
**There's a lot of forces at play currently in the market, and a greater (localized) # of reasons to be optimistic about XLM.**
Hell, even as a basic mechanism of exchange, the speed with which I transferred the bulk of my XLM to a hardware wallet (compared to BTC and even LTC, which I feel is a solid and practically useful crypto - compared to BTC - cannot be beat)
I'm still a few K in the green, so not losing any sleep
&amp;#x200B;
Just my 2 cents, good luck all and try to not let emotion and unrealized losses distort your ability to reason and hold out for the *medium* term.

**Edit: final thought, looking at the CBpro orderbook scroll right now, can't help but feel sort of bad for those who are still unloading sums &gt; 10K xlm in sells, doesn't seem like a prudent time (after a whole day of rapid dumping) to do so but hopefully I don't eat these words**",1608760415,1608778415,12/23/2020 16:53,0

11824,11824,Big-Hold826,"what?... Like I said Jed was given the xrp and was not associated with ripple when he began to sell. Because he was an outside entity who was not vested in ripple's success ie why he kept dumping his severence on the markets based on ripple's signed agreement. The fact ripple made Jed sign a agreement on how much he could dump and when proves xrp is undoubtedly tied to ripple's success and is a security. 
XLM isnt tied to Stellars success because of the fact that supporters and devs of the network can add their own tokens. XLM token is only needed for fees which are 0.00001 xlm per operation. Thats why stellar burned half of the supply because they are a ""non profit"" and don't need to make a profit. 
Giving away xlm is like giving away gasoline for a car, the price fluctuates of course, but my intention is to get your vehicle running that you built in my shop. I don't profit if the gas I hold is going up in price because I'm giving it away for free ($0). The only way XLM would go up in price is through natural supply and demand in the market between all commodity holders. 
Ripple promoted XRP nonstop and referred to xrp as ripple in the early stages. Stellar only talks about the Stellar Protocol and hardly mentions the lumen unless touching base on a function of use. If Stellar was a easier fish to fry they would have gone after them first but they didn't and they're going to be busy with ripple for a couple of years so Stellar will be far more decentralized before the SEC is free to do anything else.",1608721150,1608739150,12/23/2020 5:59,1

The possibility of malware is likely if you just visit any website that is equipped with malware. Not every anti-virus can detect new malware so it's likely you may not detect it on your PC either.

From its first announcement, it was exactly the tool Stellarscam.report wanted to collaborate with and supply vital data that can assist in real-time prevention of scams.

The end goal is to streamline this data automatically so it can update certain applications in the ecosystem that can flag and warn others in the ecosystem about potential fraud and scams.

Obviously there should be easy ways to use stellar for whatever people want, and that includes to make markets and provide liquidity, as well as lending / borrowing markets. You can roll your own solutions if you know how to code, but given the explosion in network usage in the case of ETH, it foreshadows what happens to any network when enabling platforms are built clean and simple.
Stellar has already achieved what many networks have failed to do, meet scalability at a minimal transaction cost with high security while working closely within the regulatory framework.

Referring you back to this, where McCaleb received a legal memo:
`3. Ripple engaged in this illegal securities offering from 2013 to the present, even though Ripple received legal advice as early as 2012 that under certain circumstances XRP could be considered an ‚Äúinvestment contract‚Äù and therefore a security under the federal securities laws.`
`53. ... If individuals purchased XRP ‚Äúto engage in speculative investment trading‚Äù or if Ripple employees promoted XRP as potentially increasing in price, the Legal Memos warned that Ripple would face an increased risk that XRP units would be considered investment contracts (and thus securities).`
Which they evidently ignored and carried on selling XRP anyway. 99% of XLM trade is speculative.

11870,11870,froocpu,"Did you read the SEC complaint?
`1. From at least 2013 through the present, Defendants sold over 14.6 billion units of a digital asset security called ‚ÄúXRP,‚Äù in return for cash or other consideration worth over $1.38 billion U.S. Dollars (‚ÄúUSD‚Äù), to fund Ripple‚Äôs operations and enrich Larsen and Garlinghouse`
Replace ""XRP"" with ""XLM"", ""Ripple"" with ""SDF"" and ""\[Larsen and Garlinghouse\]"" for McCaleb and friends and the logic applies.
`3. Ripple engaged in this illegal securities offering from 2013 to the present, even though Ripple received legal advice as early as 2012 that under certain circumstances XRP could be considered an ‚Äúinvestment contract‚Äù and therefore a security under the federal securities laws.`
That 50b token burn suddenly isn't looking so smart.
`20. Co-Founder, age 45, is a California resident who co-founded Ripple and received nine billion XRP shortly after Ripple‚Äôs founding.`

Yeah I also agree with you actually and I‚Äôm not defending XRP as well. And my comment above is definitely not mean that the FSA of Japan is opposed to the SEC's judgment on XRP. This is just all about ‚Äúthe definition of securities‚Äù in Japan and in the USA are by no means synonymous. 
On top of that, the biggest criterion for whether XRP is considered a security or not may not just be ""sell something to rise capital"" but ""Is the value of XRP linked to the performance of Ripple Inc?"" That makes more sense for me to understand. If all that‚Äôs said is ""sell something to raise capital"", a cryptocurrency involved in this securities controversy will extend not only to XRP but also to many cryptocurrencies and crypto industry as a whole, and it may become a tsunami of prosecution after prosecution after setting a precedent for defeating Ripple Inc by the SEC.
If the value of XRP and the performance of Ripple were linked, then the buyer of XRP was considered to be buying XRP for the purpose of profit from Ripple Inc, and this looks like Ripple Inc. was issuing a ‚ÄúStock Certificate‚Äù called XRP. This is exactly one example of a security, in addition to it, the SEC points out that XRP may also violate ‚ÄúInvestment Contract‚Äù rules. I‚Äôm not familiar with the rules at all but I think the SEC has a wide range of securities concepts than the FSA of Japan in a sense.
How about in Japan? No, XRP is not a security but just one of cryptocurrencies. Mr. Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings and director of Ripple in Japan said in his interacting with the FSA, they had stated that they would not consider XRP as a security.
So, again, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs sad that countries have different views on a particular cryptocurrency. This is not really good for the future crypto space we are excited about. And that‚Äôs why I would like XRP (I mean the Ripple Inc.) to do its best in this regard against the SEC.",1608662441,1608680441,12/22/2020 13:40,1

Ripple is in hot water with the SEC because they did not register as a security, and they acted to ""secure"" XPR as a profitable investment.
They did this by manipulating the price of XRP by systematically buying up XRP to ""encourage healthy market price.""
""The term ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù means any note, stock, treasury stock,¬†security¬†future,¬†security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment ...ock,¬†security¬†future,¬†security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any **profit-sharing** agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment ...

SDF is and has always been a Non profit organization. They never marketed, promoted, promised, or implied that buying XLM would be profitable.
This has been brought up in chat many times by disgruntled hodlers that SDF should be investing more into marketing and promotion, and this is exactly why they never did partake in any of that.
SDF has worked hard to comply with regulations, and may likely prevail because of this.

Are you someone who wanted to hide your crypto holdings? Are you someone who is trying to protect your identity? Well now they technically know where you live and so that information can be constantly re-pasted on the web multiple times making that information public and open to attack potentially *forever*... until the information becomes useless or is incorrect when you move to a new postal address / change your phone number / make a new email address etc.
At the end of the day, it's information and the main thing that can be done is using it to do more socially engineering attacks on you. They can come tomorrow, they can come next week, they can come next year. They can come for you or a family / friend. It can be very sophisticated or you might catch the first spelling mistake instantly. There is no telling what can happen but the best thing you can right do now is:
&gt;First, never give your 24 secret word key, recovery or secret passphrase to anyone. Never enter it into any app or website and this passphrase should only be inputted into the Ledger device.
&gt;Go onto https://haveibeenpwned.com/ immediately and check if your email was exposed due to the Ledger.com data breach.
&gt;If you receive any postal mail, SMS text-message, emails or even phone calls about your Ledger device, do not act upon it or follow any instructions. Instead, contact Ledger support to confirm if the information you received is a scam. 
There has been multiple accounts of people reporting extortion attempts but all of these are simply scare tactics to take your money. 
Finally, don't forget to stay calm and understand that the likelihood of someone actually trying to come to your address is almost zero as that person can't even go outside due to COVID restrictions, as well as who is really going to gamble on trying to go an address to steal their crypto because of information they saw online?

12194,12194,eurtousd,"&gt; I‚Äôm trying to think what can I actually use $XLM for? Literally nothing that I can think of. So where is all these transactions going and being used for ?
Yes, unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you see it) it seems most transactions are occurring in developing countries. For now. But this has been SDF's message from the beginning, ""Bank the unbanked."" See Tempo/Cowrie with remittances between Europe &amp; Africa, see DSTOQ currently only available in emerging markets, see Settle/Vibrant/Saldo in LATAM, see Velo/Lightnet in SE Asia which you could argue is a developing region. 
&gt;I can‚Äôt go to Walmart and pay with XLM
Believe me, I'd like to see more uses in developed countries as much as you. But as it stands, for me personally in Europe, I currently don't really have a use for XLM either. There is SatoshiPay, but I don't really have a need for them. There is Keybase, but I don't really use that anymore. There is Litemint, but I don't really play that. There is Tempo, but I don't send money cross-border. There are some Point-of-Sale systems like Lettucepay, TillBilly (haven't heard from them in a while), Salamantex, as well as eCommerce like Coinqvest, but stores also need to be willing to use and accept them (and people also need to be willing to pay with them!), and I think until regulations are more clear (although SDF is trying hard to be a voice of reason within the regulation talks) they will be hesitant to use them and just accept BTC since that's really all the average Joe knows.
The challenge is of course not to just build a network, but get people to use the network. But if no one is using it, how do you attract big players and developers and prove that it should be used? So I understand that it isn't easy for people like you in the US or me in Europe who are kind of just sitting around waiting to really be able to use the network, but we can still do our part to raise awareness; and I think (and hope) that as more use cases emerge in developing countries that more people will wake up and see stellar for what it is.
Jed once said something along the lines of a snowball effect and I really believe that. The more development that occurs, the more people will become aware and build on it and it will increase exponentially. Look at the network: https://stellar.expert/explorer/public. It isn't exponential yet, but you can see the increase in operations on the network over the years. And keep in mind that bitcoin is around 12 years old whereas stellar is about 6 or so. So think of BTC back in 2014 and compare that to where stellar is now in 2020, and IMO in terms of development stellar leads.",1608490124,1608508124,12/20/2020 13:48,0
